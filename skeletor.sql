Companies are proud of their long feature lists and consumers love to compare the features of their new gadget against that of their friends’. But there is one thing that’s even more important than all of this. The user interface (UI).<span id=\"more-10\"> </span>\n\nThe user interface is the gateway between the person using a product and its feature set — indeed, without a UI, the user wouldn’t be able to interact with their gadget or app. Make a bad UI and the user won’t be able to get to half the features your product has (and that’s if you’re lucky). They just won’t be able to navigate to the feature they were looking for, won’t figure out how to use it or simply won’t even know it’s there.\n\nUI is the key feature of any tech product for three reasons:\n<h3>1. The UI controls the user’s access to all the features a device or application has.</h3>\nTo use an app or a gadget, people have to use it’s interface — there’s really no other way to interact with it. To call someone, you have to use a phone’s keypad. To get to a webpage, you have to type it into the address bar of your browser. To change the settings of your word processor, you have to navigate to them using the menu controls. The more complicated and difficult the UI, the less features people will use â€” they just won’t figure out how to get to them and how to use them.\n<h3>2. The UI stays with the user most of the time — it delivers user experience.</h3>\nAll the controls, buttons and menus of a UI stay with the user pretty much all the time — and a lot of that time is spent interacting with them. The UI then, plays a huge part in delivering user experience. Make a difficult and slow interface and people will get frustrated and annoyed. Make a great interface and people will enjoy using your product.\n<h3>3. The UI creates friction between the user and their work.</h3>\nA bad UI will create a lot of friction — tasks will take longer to complete simply because there are more buttons to click and more menus to navigate. Even if the user knows what they’re doing, a bad UI will negatively affect productivity and slow them down.\n\nI’d say those three points are pretty important.\n\nWhy then do so many developers ignore this and produce apps and gadgets with awful interfaces that most people can’t figure out how to use?\n\nThis seems to be because many developers underestimate the difficulty of making a good UI. There is a lack of respect for designers, who are considered the people who just make things look nice. That of course is wrong. UI design is the hard part, in many cases much harder than the back-end code. Designing a good UI isn’t figuring out what something will <em>look</em> like — it’s figuring out how something will <em>work</em>.\n\nJohn Gruber of <a href=\"http://www.daringfireball.net\">Daring Fireball</a> wrote a nice article a while back on <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2004/04/spray_on_usability\">“spray-on usability”</a> in open source software. He writes:\n<div class=\"quote_box\">UI development is the hard part. And it’s not the last step, it’s the first step. In my estimation, the difference between:\n<ul>\n	<li>software that performs function X; and</li>\n	<li>software that performs function X, with an intuitive well-designed user interface</li>\n</ul>\nisn’t just a little bit of extra work. It’s not even twice the work. It’s an entire order of magnitude more work. Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work.\n<div class=\"quote_source\">John Gruber, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net\">Daring Fireball</a></div>\n</div>\nWhat’s more, there seems to be a complete ignorance of the importance of UI in many circles — just look at people bashing the iPhone for it’s lack of features. “Sure” they say, “the iPhone has a pretty interface, but my Windows Mobile phone has tons more features”.\n\nBut wait — how many features do you actually use on that thing? The iPhone delivers ease of use and user experience. People actually use all the features it provides, because they are easy to get to and easy to figure out. It’s actually a joy to use this phone — it makes you want to explore, to press all the buttons, to use all the features. The UI is what makes this product great, not it’s feature set.\n<h3>UI is the killer feature</h3>\nThe user interface isn’t just the outer wrapper of a gadget or application that’s there to make it look good — it’s a map to the features the product offers and the vehicle that takes you there. Creating a good UI is absolutely vital if you want to make a successful product.\n\nCompanies like Apple have really grasped this concept and focus all their attention on making the interface as good as possible. Others who ignore the importance of UI make products that have long feature lists, but are really unusable because of their clunky navigation, difficult controls and uninviting aesthetic. These products deliver frustration — not a good user experience.\n\nDon’t underestimate the importance of UI — it’s your product’s most important feature.','aa-UI is the Killer Feature','','publish','closed','closed','','ui-is-the-killer-feature','','','2008-04-01 00:07:44','2008-04-01 00:07:44','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?page_id=12',0,'page','',0),(38,1,'2008-09-24 00:05:07','2008-09-24 00:05:07','This is an example of a really short page with little content.','aa-Stories','','publish','open','closed','','stories','','','2008-09-24 00:05:07','2008-09-24 00:05:07','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?page_id=6',0,'page','',0),(17,1,'2009-01-24 00:18:43','2009-01-24 00:18:43','<ul>\n	<li>Really Long Page</li>\n	<li>Child of Stories Page</li>\n	<li>Contains Uploaded Image - No Alignment, Original Size, With Caption, Description and Link</li>\n	<li>Simple Formatting including bold, headers and italic.</li>\n</ul>\n[caption id=\"attachment_18\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"192\" caption=\"This is the caption for the book title\"]<a href=\"http://craphound.com/down/Cory_Doctorow_-_Down_and_Out_in_the_Magic_Kingdom.htm\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-18\" title=\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" src=\"http://wordpress.milabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cover-small.jpg\" alt=\"This is the caption for the book title\" width=\"192\" height=\"280\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<em><strong>By Cory Doctorow</strong></em>\n<div id=\"prologue\">\n<h1>PROLOGUE</h1>\nI lived long enough to see the cure for death; to see the rise of 	the Bitchun Society, to learn ten languages; to compose three 	symphonies; to realize my boyhood dream of taking up residence in 	Disney World; to see the death of the workplace and of work.\n\nI never thought I\'d live to see the day when Keep 	A-Movin\' Dan would decide to deadhead until the heat 	death of the Universe.\n\nDan was in his second or third blush of youth when I first met 	him, sometime late-XXI. He was a rangy cowpoke, apparent 25 or so, 	all rawhide squint-lines and sunburned neck, boots worn thin and 	infinitely comfortable. I was in the middle of my Chem thesis, my 	fourth Doctorate, and he was taking a break from Saving the World, 	chilling on campus in Toronto and core-dumping for some poor Anthro 	major. We hooked up at the Grad Students\' Union—the 	GSU, or Gazoo for those who knew—on a busy Friday night, 	summer-ish. I was fighting a coral-slow battle for a stool at the 	scratched bar, inching my way closer every time the press of bodies 	shifted, and he had one of the few seats, surrounded by a litter of 	cigarette junk and empties, clearly encamped.\n\nSome duration into my foray, he cocked his head at me and raised 	a sun-bleached eyebrow. “You get any closer, son, and 	we\'re going to have to get a pre-nup.”\n\nI was apparent forty or so, and I thought about bridling at being 	called son, but I looked into his eyes and decided that he had 	enough realtime that he could call me son anytime he wanted. I 	backed off a little and apologized.\n\nHe struck a cig and blew a pungent, strong plume over the 	bartender\'s head. “Don\'t worry 	about it. I\'m probably a little over accustomed to 	personal space.”\n\nI couldn\'t remember the last time I\'d 	heard anyone on-world talk about personal space. With the mortality 	rate at zero and the birth-rate at non-zero, the world was 	inexorably accreting a dense carpet of people, even with the 	migratory and deadhead drains on the population. “You\'ve 	been jaunting?” I asked—his 	eyes were too sharp for him to have missed an instant\'s 	experience to deadheading.\n\nHe chuckled. “No sir, not me. I\'m into the 	kind of macho shitheadery that you only come across on-world. 	Jaunting\'s for play; I need work.” The bar-glass tinkled a counterpoint.\n\nI took a moment to conjure a HUD with his Whuffie score on it. I 	had to resize the window—he had too many zeroes to fit 	on my standard display. I tried to act cool, but he caught the 	upwards flick of my eyes and then their involuntary widening. He 	tried a little aw-shucksery, gave it up and let a prideful grin 	show.\n\n“I try not to pay it much mind. Some people, they get 	overly grateful.” He must\'ve 	seen my eyes flick up again, to pull his Whuffie history. “Wait, 	don\'t go doing that—I\'ll tell 	you about it, you really got to know.\n\n“Damn, you know, it\'s so easy to get used 	to life without hyperlinks. You\'d think you\'d 	really miss \'em, but you don\'t.”\n\nAnd it clicked for me. He was a missionary—one of 	those fringe-dwellers who act as emissary from the Bitchun Society 	to the benighted corners of the world where, for whatever reasons, 	they want to die, starve, and choke on petrochem waste. It\'s 	amazing that these communities survive more than a generation; in 	the Bitchun Society proper, we usually outlive our detractors. The 	missionaries don\'t have such a high success rate—you 	have to be awfully convincing to get through to a culture that\'s 	already successfully resisted nearly a century\'s worth 	of propaganda—but when you convert a whole village, you 	accrue all the Whuffie they have to give. More often, missionaries 	end up getting refreshed from a backup after they aren\'t 	heard from for a decade or so. I\'d never met one in the 	flesh before.\n\n“How many successful missions have you had?” I asked.\n\n“Figured it out, huh? I\'ve just come off 	my fifth in twenty years—counterrevolutionaries hidden 	out in the old Cheyenne Mountain NORAD site, still there a 	generation later.” He sandpapered 	his whiskers with his fingertips. “Their parents went to 	ground after their life\'s savings vanished, and they had 	no use for tech any more advanced than a rifle. Plenty of those, 	though.”\n\nHe spun a fascinating yarn then, how he slowly gained the 	acceptance of the mountain-dwellers, and then their trust, and then 	betrayed it in subtle, beneficent ways: introducing Free Energy to 	their greenhouses, then a gengineered crop or two, then curing a 	couple deaths, slowly inching them toward the Bitchun Society, until 	they couldn\'t remember why they hadn\'t 	wanted to be a part of it from the start. Now they were mostly 	off-world, exploring toy frontiers with unlimited energy and 	unlimited supplies and deadheading through the dull times en route.\n\n“I guess it\'d be too much of a shock for 	them to stay on-world. They think of us as the enemy, you 	know—they had all kinds of plans drawn up for when we 	invaded them and took them away; hollow suicide teeth, booby-traps, 	fall-back-and-rendezvous points for the survivors. They just can\'t 	get over hating us, even though we don\'t even know they 	exist. Off-world, they can pretend that they\'re still 	living rough and hard.” He rubbed 	his chin again, his hard calluses grating over his whiskers. “But 	for me, the real rough life is right here, on-world. The little 	enclaves, each one is like an alternate history of humanity—what 	if we\'d taken the Free Energy, but not deadheading? What 	if we\'d taken deadheading, but only for the critically 	ill, not for people who didn\'t want to be bored on long 	bus-rides? Or no hyperlinks, no ad-hocracy, no Whuffie? Each one is 	different and wonderful.”\n\nI have a stupid habit of arguing for the sake of, and I found 	myself saying, “Wonderful? Oh sure, nothing finer than, 	oh, let\'s see, dying, starving, freezing, broiling, 	killing, cruelty and ignorance and pain and misery. I know I sure 	miss it.”\n\nKeep A-Movin\' Dan snorted. “You think a 	junkie misses sobriety?”\n\nI knocked on the bar. “Hello! There aren\'t 	any junkies anymore!”\n\nHe struck another cig. “But you know what a junkie <em>is</em>, 	right? Junkies don\'t miss sobriety, because they don\'t 	remember how sharp everything was, how the pain made the joy 	sweeter. We can\'t remember what it was like to work to 	earn our keep; to worry that there might not be <em>enough</em>, 	that we might get sick or get hit by a bus. We don\'t 	remember what it was like to take chances, and we sure as shit 	don\'t remember what it felt like to have them pay 	off.”\n\nHe had a point. Here I was, only in my second or third adulthood, 	and already ready to toss it all in and do something, <em>anything</em>, 	else. He had a point—but I wasn\'t about to 	admit it. “So you say. I say, I take a chance when I 	strike up a conversation in a bar, when I fall in love… and what about the deadheads? Two people I know, they just went 	deadhead for ten thousand years! Tell me that\'s not 	taking a chance!” Truth be told, 	almost everyone I\'d known in my eighty-some years were 	deadheading or jaunting or just <em>gone</em>. Lonely days, then.\n\n“Brother, that\'s committing half-assed 	suicide. The way we\'re going, they\'ll be 	lucky if someone doesn\'t just switch \'em off 	when it comes time to reanimate. In case you haven\'t 	noticed, it\'s getting a little crowded around here.”\n\nI made pish-tosh sounds and wiped off my forehead with a 	bar-napkin—the Gazoo was beastly hot on summer nights. 	“Uh-huh, just like the world was getting a little crowded 	a hundred years ago, before Free Energy. Like it was getting too 	greenhousey, too nukey, too hot or too cold. We fixed it then, 	we\'ll fix it again when the time comes. I\'m 	gonna be here in ten thousand years, you damn betcha, but I think 	I\'ll do it the long way around.”\n\nHe cocked his head again, and gave it some thought. If it had 	been any of the other grad students, I\'d have assumed he 	was grepping for some bolstering factoids to support his next sally. 	But with him, I just knew he was thinking about it, the 	old-fashioned way.\n\n“I think that if I\'m still here in ten 	thousand years, I\'m going to be crazy as hell. Ten 	thousand years, pal! Ten thousand years ago, the state-of-the-art 	was a goat. You really think you\'re going to be anything 	recognizably human in a hundred centuries? Me, I\'m not 	interested in being a post-person. I\'m going to wake up 	one day, and I\'m going to say, ‘Well, I guess 	I\'ve seen about enough,’ and that\'ll 	be my last day.”\n\nI had seen where he was going with this, and I had stopped paying 	attention while I readied my response. I probably should have paid 	more attention. “But why? Why not just deadhead for a few 	centuries, see if there\'s anything that takes your 	fancy, and if not, back to sleep for a few more? Why do anything so 	<em>final</em>?”\n\nHe embarrassed me by making a show of thinking it over again, 	making me feel like I was just a half-pissed glib poltroon. “I 	suppose it\'s because nothing else is. I\'ve 	always known that someday, I was going to stop moving, stop seeking, 	stop kicking, and have done with it. There\'ll come a day 	when I don\'t have anything left to do, except stop.”\n\n<hr /></div>\nOn campus, they called him Keep-A-Movin\' Dan, because of his cowboy vibe and because of his lifestyle, and he somehow grew to take over every conversation I had for the next six months. I pinged his Whuffie a few times, and noticed that it was climbing steadily upward as he accumulated more esteem from the people he met.\n\nI\'d pretty much pissed away most of my Whuffie—all the savings from the symphonies and the first three theses—drinking myself stupid at the Gazoo, hogging library terminals, pestering profs, until I\'d expended all the respect anyone had ever afforded me. All except Dan, who, for some reason, stood me to regular beers and meals and movies.\n\nI got to feeling like I was someone special—not everyone had a chum as exotic as Keep-A-Movin\' Dan, the legendary missionary who visited the only places left that were closed to the Bitchun Society. I can\'t say for sure why he hung around with me. He mentioned once or twice that he\'d liked my symphonies, and he\'d read my Ergonomics thesis on applying theme-park crowd-control techniques in urban settings, and liked what I had to say there. But I think it came down to us having a good time needling each other.\n\nI\'d talk to him about the vast carpet of the future unrolling before us, of the certainty that we would encounter alien intelligences some day, of the unimaginable frontiers open to each of us. He\'d tell me that deadheading was a strong indicator that one\'s personal reservoir of introspection and creativity was dry; and that without struggle, there is no real victory.\n\nThis was a good fight, one we could have a thousand times without resolving. I\'d get him to concede that Whuffie recaptured the true essence of money: in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you wouldn\'t starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented—your personal capital with your friends and neighbors—you more accurately gauged your success.\n\nAnd then he\'d lead me down a subtle, carefully baited trail that led to my allowing that while, yes, we might someday encounter alien species with wild and fabulous ways, that right now, there was a slightly depressing homogeneity to the world.\n\nOn a fine spring day, I defended my thesis to two embodied humans and one prof whose body was out for an overhaul, whose consciousness was present via speakerphone from the computer where it was resting. They all liked it. I collected my sheepskin and went out hunting for Dan in the sweet, flower-stinking streets.\n\nHe\'d gone. The Anthro major he\'d been torturing with his war-stories said that they\'d wrapped up that morning, and he\'d headed to the walled city of Tijuana, to take his shot with the descendants of a platoon of US Marines who\'d settled there and cut themselves off from the Bitchun Society.\n\nSo I went to Disney World.\n\nIn deference to Dan, I took the flight in realtime, in the minuscule cabin reserved for those of us who stubbornly refused to be frozen and stacked like cordwood for the two hour flight. I was the only one taking the trip in realtime, but a flight attendant dutifully served me a urine-sample-sized orange juice and a rubbery, pungent, cheese omelet. I stared out the windows at the infinite clouds while the autopilot banked around the turbulence, and wondered when I\'d see Dan next.\n<div id=\"ch1\">\n<h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>\nMy girlfriend was 15 percent of my age, and I was old-fashioned 	enough that it bugged me. Her name was Lil, and she was 	second-generation Disney World, her parents being among the original 	ad-hocracy that took over the management of Liberty Square and Tom 	Sawyer Island. She was, quite literally, raised in Walt Disney World 	and it showed.\n\nIt showed. She was neat and efficient in her every little thing, 	from her shining red hair to her careful accounting of each gear and 	cog in the animatronics that were in her charge. Her folks were in 	canopic jars in Kissimmee, deadheading for a few centuries.\n\nOn a muggy Wednesday, we dangled our feet over the edge of the 	Liberty Belle\'s riverboat pier, watching the listless 	Confederate flag over Fort Langhorn on Tom Sawyer Island by 	moonlight. The Magic Kingdom was all closed up and every last guest 	had been chased out the gate underneath the Main Street train 	station, and we were able to breathe a heavy sigh of relief, shuck 	parts of our costumes, and relax together while the cicadas sang.\n\nI was more than a century old, but there was still a kind of 	magic in having my arm around the warm, fine shoulders of a girl by 	moonlight, hidden from the hustle of the cleaning teams by the 	turnstiles, breathing the warm, moist air. Lil plumped her head 	against my shoulder and gave me a butterfly kiss under my jaw.\n\n“Her name was McGill,” I 	sang, gently.\n\n“But she called herself Lil,” she sang, warm breath on my collarbones.\n\n“And everyone knew her as Nancy,” I sang.\n\nI\'d been startled to know that she knew the Beatles. 	They\'d been old news in my youth, after all. But her 	parents had given her a thorough—if 	eclectic—education.\n\n“Want to do a walk-through?” she asked. It was one of her favorite duties, exploring every 	inch of the rides in her care with the lights on, after the horde of 	tourists had gone. We both liked to see the underpinnings of the 	magic. Maybe that was why I kept picking at the relationship.\n\n“I\'m a little pooped. Let\'s 	sit a while longer, if you don\'t mind.”\n\nShe heaved a dramatic sigh. “Oh, all right. Old 	man.” She reached up and gently 	tweaked my nipple, and I gave a satisfying little jump. I think the 	age difference bothered her, too, though she teased me for letting 	it get to me.\n\n“I think I\'ll be able to manage a totter 	through the Haunted Mansion, if you just give me a moment to rest my 	bursitis.” I felt her smile against 	my shirt. She loved the Mansion; loved to turn on the ballroom 	ghosts and dance their waltz with them on the dusty floor, loved to 	try and stare down the marble busts in the library that followed 	your gaze as you passed.\n\nI liked it too, but I really liked just sitting there with her, 	watching the water and the trees. I was just getting ready to go 	when I heard a soft <em>ping</em> inside my cochlea. “Damn,” I said. “I\'ve got a call.”\n\n“Tell them you\'re busy,” she said.\n\n“I will,” I said, and 	answered the call subvocally. “Julius here.”\n\n“Hi, Julius. It\'s Dan. You got a 	minute?”\n\nI knew a thousand Dans, but I recognized the voice immediately, 	though it\'d been ten years since we last got drunk at 	the Gazoo together. I muted the subvocal and said, “Lil, 	I\'ve got to take this. Do you mind?”\n\n“Oh, <em>no</em>, not at all,” she sarcased at me. She sat up and pulled out her crack pipe 	and lit up.\n\n“Dan,” I 	subvocalized, “long time no speak.”\n\n“Yeah, buddy, it sure has been,” he said, and his voice cracked on a sob.\n\nI turned and gave Lil such a look, she dropped her pipe. “How 	can I help?” she said, softly but 	swiftly. I waved her off and switched the phone to full-vocal mode. 	My voice sounded unnaturally loud in the cricket-punctuated calm.\n\n“Where you at, Dan?” I 	asked.\n\n“Down here, in Orlando. I\'m stuck out on 	Pleasure Island.”\n\n“All right,” I said. 	“Meet me at, uh, the Adventurer\'s Club, 	upstairs on the couch by the door. I\'ll be there 	in—” I shot a look at 	Lil, who knew the castmember-only roads better than I. She flashed 	ten fingers at me. “Ten minutes.”\n\n“Okay,” he said. 	“Sorry.” He had his 	voice back under control. I switched off.\n\n“What\'s up?” Lil 	asked.\n\n“I\'m not sure. An old friend is in town. 	He sounds like he\'s got a problem.”\n\nLil pointed a finger at me and made a trigger-squeezing gesture. 	“There,” she said. 	“I\'ve just dumped the best route to Pleasure 	Island to your public directory. Keep me in the loop, okay?”\n\nI set off for the utilidor entrance near the Hall of Presidents 	and booted down the stairs to the hum of the underground 	tunnel-system. I took the slidewalk to cast parking and zipped my 	little cart out to Pleasure Island.\n\n<hr />I found Dan sitting on the L-shaped couch underneath rows of 	faked-up trophy shots with humorous captions. Downstairs, 	castmembers were working the animatronic masks and idols, chattering 	with the guests.\n\nDan was apparent fifty plus, a little paunchy and stubbled. He 	had raccoon-mask bags under his eyes and he slumped listlessly. As I 	approached, I pinged his Whuffie and was startled to see that it had 	dropped to nearly zero.\n\n“Jesus,” I said, as I 	sat down next to him. “You look like hell, Dan.”\n\nHe nodded. “Appearances can be deceptive,” he said. “But in this case, they\'re 	bang-on.”\n\n“You want to talk about it?” I asked.\n\n“Somewhere else, huh? I hear they ring in the New Year 	every night at midnight; I think that\'d be a little too 	much for me right now.”\n\nI led him out to my cart and cruised back to the place I shared 	with Lil, out in Kissimmee. He smoked eight cigarettes on the twenty 	minute ride, hammering one after another into his mouth, filling my 	runabout with stinging clouds. I kept glancing at him in the 	rear-view. He had his eyes closed, and in repose he looked dead. I 	could hardly believe that this was my vibrant action-hero pal of 	yore.\n\nSurreptitiously, I called Lil\'s phone. “I\'m 	bringing him home,” I subvocalized. 	“He\'s in rough shape. Not sure what it\'s 	all about.”\n\n“I\'ll make up the couch,” she said. “And get some coffee together. Love 	you.”\n\n“Back atcha, kid,” I 	said.\n\nAs we approached the tacky little swaybacked ranch-house, he 	opened his eyes. “You\'re a pal, Jules.” I waved him off. “No, really. I tried to think of 	who I could call, and you were the only one. I\'ve missed 	you, bud.”\n\n“Lil said she\'d put some coffee on,” I said. “You sound like you need it.”\n\nLil was waiting on the sofa, a folded blanket and an extra pillow 	on the side table, a pot of coffee and some Disneyland Beijing mugs 	beside them. She stood and extended her hand. “I\'m 	Lil,” she said.\n\n“Dan,” he said. 	“It\'s a pleasure.”\n\nI knew she was pinging his Whuffie and I caught her look of 	surprised disapproval. Us oldsters who predate Whuffie know that 	it\'s important; but to the kids, it\'s the 	<em>world</em>. Someone without any is automatically suspect. I 	watched her recover quickly, smile, and surreptitiously wipe her 	hand on her jeans. “Coffee?” she said.\n\n“Oh, yeah,” Dan said, 	and slumped on the sofa.\n\nShe poured him a cup and set it on a coaster on the coffee table. 	“I\'ll let you boys catch up, then,” she said, and started for the bedroom.\n\n“No,” Dan said. 	“Wait. If you don\'t mind. I think it\'d 	help if I could talk to someone… younger, 	too.”\n\nShe set her face in the look of chirpy helpfulness that all the 	second-gen castmembers have at their instant disposal and settled 	into an armchair. She pulled out her pipe and lit a rock. I went 	through my crack period before she was born, just after they made it 	decaf, and I always felt old when I saw her and her friends light 	up. Dan surprised me by holding out a hand to her and taking the 	pipe. He toked heavily, then passed it back.\n\nDan closed his eyes again, then ground his fists into them, 	sipped his coffee. It was clear he was trying to figure out where to 	start.\n\n“I believed that I was braver than I really am, is 	what it boils down to,” he said.\n\n“Who doesn\'t?” I 	said.\n\n“I really thought I could do it. I knew that someday 	I\'d run out of things to do, things to see. I knew that 	I\'d finish some day. You remember, we used to argue 	about it. I swore I\'d be done, and that would be the end 	of it. And now I am. There isn\'t a single place left 	on-world that isn\'t part of the Bitchun Society. There 	isn\'t a single thing left that I want any part of.”\n\n“So deadhead for a few centuries,” I said. “Put the decision off.”\n\n“No!” he shouted, 	startling both of us. “I\'m <em>done</em>. 	It\'s <em>over</em>.”\n\n“So do it,” Lil said.\n\n“I <em>can\'t</em>,” he sobbed, and buried his face in his hands. He cried like a 	baby, in great, snoring sobs that shook his whole body. Lil went 	into the kitchen and got some tissue, and passed it to me. I sat 	alongside him and awkwardly patted his back.\n\n“Jesus,” he said, 	into his palms. “Jesus.”\n\n“Dan?” I said, 	quietly.\n\nHe sat up and took the tissue, wiped off his face and hands. 	“Thanks,” he said. 	“I\'ve tried to make a go of it, really I 	have. I\'ve spent the last eight years in Istanbul, 	writing papers on my missions, about the communities. I did some 	followup studies, interviews. No one was interested. Not even me. I 	smoked a lot of hash. It didn\'t help. So, one morning I 	woke up and went to the bazaar and said good bye to the friends 	I\'d made there. Then I went to a pharmacy and had the 	man make me up a lethal injection. He wished me good luck and I went 	back to my rooms. I sat there with the hypo all afternoon, then I 	decided to sleep on it, and I got up the next morning and did it all 	over again. I looked inside myself, and I saw that I didn\'t 	have the guts. I just didn\'t have the guts. I\'ve 	stared down the barrels of a hundred guns, had a thousand knives 	pressed up against my throat, but I didn\'t have the guts 	to press that button.”\n\n“You were too late,” Lil 	said.\n\nWe both turned to look at her.\n\n“You were a decade too late. Look at you. You\'re 	pathetic. If you killed yourself right now, you\'d just 	be a washed-up loser who couldn\'t hack it. If you\'d 	done it ten years earlier, you would\'ve been going out 	on top—a champion, retiring permanently.” She set her mug down with a harder-than-necessary clunk.\n\nSometimes, Lil and I are right on the same wavelength. Sometimes, 	it\'s like she\'s on a different planet. All I 	could do was sit there, horrified, and she was happy to discuss the 	timing of my pal\'s suicide.\n\nBut she was right. Dan nodded heavily, and I saw that he knew it, 	too.\n\n“A day late and a dollar short,” he sighed.\n\n“Well, don\'t just sit there,” she said. “You know what you\'ve got to 	do.”\n\n“What?” I said, 	involuntarily irritated by her tone.\n\nShe looked at me like I was being deliberately stupid. “He\'s 	got to get back on top. Cleaned up, dried out, into some productive 	work. Get that Whuffie up, too. <em>Then</em> he can kill himself 	with dignity.”\n\nIt was the stupidest thing I\'d ever heard. Dan, 	though, was cocking an eyebrow at her and thinking hard. “How 	old did you say you were?” he 	asked.\n\n“Twenty-three,” she 	said.\n\n“Wish I\'d had your smarts at 	twenty-three,” he said, and heaved 	a sigh, straightening up. “Can I stay here while I get 	the job done?”\n\nI looked askance at Lil, who considered for a moment, then 	nodded.\n\n“Sure, pal, sure,” I 	said. I clapped him on the shoulder. “You look beat.”\n\n“Beat doesn\'t begin to cover it,” he said.\n\n“Good night, then,” I 	said.</div>\n<div id=\"ch2\">\n<h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>\nAd-hocracy works well, for the most part. Lil\'s folks 	had taken over the running of Liberty Square with a group of other 	interested, compatible souls. They did a fine job, racked up gobs of 	Whuffie, and anyone who came around and tried to take it over would 	be so reviled by the guests they wouldn\'t find a pot to 	piss in. Or they\'d have such a wicked, radical approach 	that they\'d ouster Lil\'s parents and their 	pals, and do a better job.\n\nIt can break down, though. There were pretenders to the 	throne—a group who\'d worked with the 	original ad-hocracy and then had moved off to other pursuits—some 	of them had gone to school, some of them had made movies, written 	books, or gone off to Disneyland Beijing to help start things up. A 	few had deadheaded for a couple decades.\n\nThey came back to Liberty Square with a message: update the 	attractions. The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest 	conservatives in the Magic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing 	technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily. The 	newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had 	their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of 	it.\n\nSo it fell to Lil to make sure that there were no bugs in the 	meager attractions of Liberty Square: the Hall of the Presidents, 	the Liberty Belle riverboat, and the glorious Haunted Mansion, 	arguably the coolest attraction to come from the fevered minds of 	the old-time Disney Imagineers.\n\nI caught her backstage at the Hall of the Presidents, tinkering 	with Lincoln II, the backup animatronic. Lil tried to keep two of 	everything running at speed, just in case. She could swap out a dead 	bot for a backup in five minutes flat, which is all that 	crowd-control would permit.\n\nIt had been two weeks since Dan\'s arrival, and though 	I\'d barely seen him in that time, his presence was vivid 	in our lives. Our little ranch-house had a new smell, not 	unpleasant, of rejuve and hope and loss, something barely noticeable 	over the tropical flowers nodding in front of our porch. My phone 	rang three or four times a day, Dan checking in from his rounds of 	the Park, seeking out some way to accumulate personal capital. His 	excitement and dedication to the task were inspiring, pulling me 	into his over-the-top-and-damn-the-torpedoes mode of being.\n\n“You just missed Dan,” she 	said. She had her head in Lincoln\'s chest, working with 	an autosolder and a magnifier. Bent over, red hair tied back in a 	neat bun, sweat sheening her wiry freckled arms, smelling of 	girl-sweat and machine lubricant, she made me wish there were a 	mattress somewhere backstage. I settled for patting her behind 	affectionately, and she wriggled appreciatively. “He\'s 	looking better.”\n\nHis rejuve had taken him back to apparent 25, the way I 	remembered him. He was rawboned and leathery, but still had the 	defeated stoop that had startled me when I saw him at the 	Adventurer\'s Club. “What did he want?”\n\n“He\'s been hanging out with Debra—he 	wanted to make sure I knew what she\'s up to.”\n\nDebra was one of the old guard, a former comrade of Lil\'s 	parents. She\'d spent a decade in Disneyland Beijing, 	coding sim-rides. If she had her way, we\'d tear down 	every marvelous rube goldberg in the Park and replace them with 	pristine white sim boxes on giant, articulated servos.\n\nThe problem was that she was <em>really good</em> at coding sims. 	Her Great Movie Ride rehab at MGM was breathtaking—the 	Star Wars sequence had already inspired a hundred fan-sites that 	fielded millions of hits.\n\nShe\'d leveraged her success into a deal with the 	Adventureland ad-hocs to rehab the Pirates of the Caribbean, and 	their backstage areas were piled high with reference: treasure 	chests and cutlasses and bowsprits. It was terrifying to walk 	through; the Pirates was the last ride Walt personally supervised, 	and we\'d thought it was sacrosanct. But Debra had built 	a Pirates sim in Beijing, based on Chend I Sao, the XIXth century 	Chinese pirate queen, which was credited with rescuing the Park from 	obscurity and ruin. The Florida iteration would incorporate the best 	aspects of its Chinese cousin—the AI-driven sims that 	communicated with each other and with the guests, greeting them by 	name each time they rode and spinning age-appropriate tales of 	piracy on the high seas; the spectacular fly-through of the aquatic 	necropolis of rotting junks on the sea-floor; the thrilling pitch 	and yaw of the sim as it weathered a violent, breath-taking 	storm—but with Western themes: wafts of Jamaican pepper 	sauce crackling through the air; liquid Afro-Caribbean accents; and 	swordfights conducted in the manner of the pirates who plied the 	blue waters of the New World. Identical sims would stack like 	cordwood in the space currently occupied by the bulky ride-apparatus 	and dioramas, quintupling capacity and halving load-time.\n\n“So, what\'s she up to?”\n\nLil extracted herself from the Rail-Splitter\'s 	mechanical guts and made a comical moue of worry. “She\'s 	rehabbing the Pirates—and doing an incredible job. 	They\'re ahead of schedule, they\'ve got good 	net-buzz, the focus groups are cumming themselves.” The comedy went out of her expression, baring genuine worry.\n\nShe turned away and closed up Honest Abe, then fired her finger 	at him. Smoothly, he began to run through his spiel, silent but for 	the soft hum and whine of his servos. Lil mimed twiddling a knob and 	his audiotrack kicked in low: “All the armies of Europe, 	Asia, and Africa <em>combined</em> could not, by force, make a track 	on the Blue Ridge, nor take a drink from the Ohio. If destruction be 	our lot, then we ourselves must be its author—and its 	finisher.” She mimed turning down 	the gain and he fell silent again.\n\n“You said it, Mr. President,” she said, and fired her finger at him again, powering him 	down. She bent and adjusted his hand-sewn period topcoat, then 	carefully wound and set the turnip-watch in his vest-pocket.\n\nI put my arm around her shoulders. “You\'re 	doing all you can—and it\'s good work,” I said. I\'d fallen into the easy castmember mode 	of speaking, voicing bland affirmations. Hearing the words, I felt a 	flush of embarrassment. I pulled her into a long, hard hug and 	fumbled for better reassurance. Finding no words that would do, I 	gave her a final squeeze and let her go.\n\nShe looked at me sidelong and nodded her head. “It\'ll 	be fine, of course,” she said. “I 	mean, the worst possible scenario is that Debra will do her job 	very, very well, and make things even better than they are now. 	That\'s not so bad.”\n\nThis was a 180-degree reversal of her position on the subject the 	last time we\'d talked, but you don\'t live 	more than a century without learning when to point out that sort of 	thing and when not to.\n\nMy cochlea struck twelve noon and a HUD appeared with my weekly 	backup reminder. Lil was maneuvering Ben Franklin II out of his 	niche. I waved good-bye at her back and walked away, to an uplink 	terminal. Once I was close enough for secure broadband 	communications, I got ready to back up. My cochlea chimed again and 	I answered it.\n\n“Yes,” I 	subvocalized, impatiently. I hated getting distracted from a 	backup—one of my enduring fears was that I\'d 	forget the backup altogether and leave myself vulnerable for an 	entire week until the next reminder. I\'d lost the knack 	of getting into habits in my adolescence, giving in completely to 	machine-generated reminders over conscious choice.\n\n“It\'s Dan.” I 	heard the sound of the Park in full swing behind him—children\'s 	laughter; bright, recorded animatronic spiels; the tromp of 	thousands of feet. “Can you meet me at the Tiki Room? 	It\'s pretty important.”\n\n“Can it wait for fifteen?” I 	asked.\n\n“Sure—see you in fifteen.”\n\nI rung off and initiated the backup. A status-bar zipped across a 	HUD, dumping the parts of my memory that were purely digital; then 	it finished and started in on organic memory. My eyes rolled back in 	my head and my life flashed before my eyes.</div>\n<div id=\"ch3\"></div>','aa-Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom','','publish','open','closed','','down-and-out-in-the-magic-kingdom','','','2009-01-24 00:18:43','2009-01-24 00:18:43','',38,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?page_id=17',0,'page','',0),(33,1,'2009-01-30 01:01:03','2009-01-30 01:01:03','ORIGINAL POST: <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/14/how-to-integrate-facebook-with-wordpress/\">http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/14/how-to-integrate-facebook-with-wordpress/</a>\n<ul>\n	<li>Includes Excerpt</li>\n	<li>4 Tags</li>\n	<li>One Child Category</li>\n</ul>\nFacebook is one of those Web phenomena that impress everyone with numbers. To cite some: about 250 million users are on Facebook, and together they spend more than 5 billion minutes on Facebook… every day. These numbers suggest that we should start thinking about how to use Facebook for blogging or vice versa.\n\nWe did some research to <strong>find out how the integration of Facebook with WordPress and vice versa works</strong>, or — in other words — how you can present your WordPress blog on Facebook or use the functionality of Facebook on your WordPress-powered blog. Both of these can be achieved with a set of WordPress plug-ins, a couple of which we’ll present here in detail.\n<h3>1. Integrating A WordPress Blog Into Facebook</h3>\nIntegrating a WordPress blog into Facebook is actually quite simply achieved via the <strong>Facebook API</strong>. The Facebook API makes programming applications that can be spread via Facebook almost a piece of cake. A lot of interactive browser games are on Facebook, such as the currently popular “Mafia Wars.” This game allows users to start a mafia family with their friends, with the goal of becoming an important figure in the virtual underground crime scene. To start a clan, you invite other friends on the network to join. This is the growth strategy of any application on Facebook: the simple snowball effect.\n\nThe applications sustain themselves through earnings generated by displaying advertisements, which also makes Facebook an even more attractive platform to develop on. This symbiosis generates growth for both Facebook and its applications.\n<h4>Plug-In Installation and Configuration</h4>\nJohn Eckman developed the WordPress plug-in <a href=\"http://www.openparenthesis.org/code/wp\">Wordbook</a> in early 2009. This plug-in allows WordPress blog owners to integrate their blog in Facebook. This gives a blog two lives: one as an application on Facebook (such as, for example, my private <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/freigeistblog/\">FreigeistBlog</a>) and one at the original URL (<a href=\"http://freigeist.devmag.net/\">http://freigeist.devmag.net</a>).\n\nTo access a blog via Facebook, you need to first grant access to the application. To do this, go to the so-called “canvas” page, which is where the Facebook twin of the blog lives (<a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/freigeistblog/\">my example</a>). However, granting access to the blog’s application means that the administrator of the blog also has access to information about you as a user (this is what most applications aim for: information such as date of birth, gender and educational status allows them to display quite targeted ads).\n\nThe application we’re dealing with is a simple blog and, in this sense, quite innocent, but we should state outright that the <strong>Facebook API as it is now treats blogs and websites as applications</strong>, which may not be appropriate, given the issue mentioned above. Facebook users who authorize the blog application can now easly send comments and share posts from within Facebook. The data, however, is still stored in the original database on the server where the blog is installed.\n\nThis makes it look as though Facebook serves merely as a simple feed reader. Yet, we get some other benefits. The blog on Facebook can be used to create a community around it by taking advantage of Facebook’s snowball effect, because friends of the blog’s users will see in their activity stream that they have been participating on the blog. Furthermore, it means that Facebook users will see new posts from your blog whenever they sign in to Facebook and can easily follow comments, making your blog more accessible.\n\nTo create a Facebook twin of your blog, first you have to <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/developers/\">set up a new application</a>. To do this, you need a Facebook account and have to register as a developer using the preceding link. All of this can be done in a few minutes.\n\n<img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-create.png\" alt=\"Create a new Facebook application\" width=\"234\" height=\"177\" />\n\n<em>Create a new Facebook application</em>\n\nOnce you have agreed to the terms of use, give your application a name. Then you will receive your API key and a secret, which you will need later.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_1.png\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img1.gif\" alt=\"Settings for a Facebook application\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\" /></a>\n\n<em>Settings for the Facebook application. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_1.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nThen, you have to submit a so-called “post-authorize callback URL.” This is the address on your server to which Facebook will send a notice whenever a user authorizes access to the application. By the same logic, there is also the “post-remove callback URL,” which receives a notice when a user removes the application. Both of these events are handled by the Wordbook plug-in. You merely need to write the address of the blog’s root directory with a trailing slash.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_2.png\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img2.gif\" alt=\"Callback URLs definieren\" width=\"550\" height=\"301\" /></a>\n\n<em>Facebook application settings: Define callback URLs. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_2.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nThe third step is to claim your canvas page, which is the page through which a Facebook user accesses your blog, and a canvas callback URL, which is the page from which content is retrieved. Again, include a trailing slash, or else internal links on your blog won’t work with their Facebook twin.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_3.png\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img3.gif\" alt=\"Define canvas page\" width=\"550\" height=\"536\" /></a>\n\n<em>Facebook application settings: Define canvas page. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-settings_3.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nNow you have some choices to make, namely, how to set up your canvas page. You have a choice between iFrame and FBML. FBML is a Facebook XML scheme with which you can use specific Facebook tags (such as tags to display user profiles). You can also use it to access certain Facebook procedures. However, the Wordbook plug-in works with iFrames, which allow Javascript and other tags, and which FBML does not support.\n\nTo distinguish between them rather crudely, you can say that iFrames give the developer more flexibility but, unlike FBML, restrict access to Facebook procedures. Another advantage of iFrames is that code that Facebook retrieves from the canvas callback URL need not be parsed by the FBML parser, which could yield a performance gain. With iFrames, only internal links on the blog need to be adjusted. And the “resizeable” option allows Facebook’s JavaScript code to adjust the size of the iFrame to Facebook’s layout.\n\nNow the hard work is done. All that’s left is to install the Wordbook <a href=\"http://www.openparenthesis.org/code/wp\">plug-in using the standard WordPress method</a>: install and activate. Then you can change the plug-in’s settings on the settings panel, and here you will need your application ID and the secret. You also have to tell the plug-in where the canvas page is located, so that internal links can be adjusted.\n\n<img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-wordbook-settings1.png\" alt=\"Settings for the Wordbook plug-in\" width=\"452\" height=\"589\" />\n\n<em>Adjusting the settings of the Wordbook plug-in</em>\n\nAnd that’s it! If you want, you could activate or deactivate some other options, such as the commenting function and whether users can add your application to their profile by displaying the latest posts from your blog in their profile.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-add-profile.png\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/img4.gif\" alt=\"Browsing through a blog via Facebook\" width=\"463\" height=\"432\" /></a>\n\n<em>Browsing through the blog via Facebook. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-application-add-profile.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nThe plug-in allows you to play around a little bit. But as we said, you are somewhat limited in how fully you can integrate your blog into the Facebook canvas. But the next plug-in we’ll look at integrates a bit of Facebook into your blog.\n<h3>2. Integrating Facebook In A WordPress Blog</h3>\nTo begin, a little history lesson is needed. Many users do not like having to register for each blog where they would like to post comments, especially if they already have accounts on so many other social networks, such as Facebook and MySpace. So a single online ID for several purposes would be ideal, wouldn’t it? That’s the idea behind the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid\">OpenID</a> protocol, which started in 2005. It decentralizes the identification of users for various providers and services. In essence, you can create an account on Facebook and connect it to services such as MySpace or even a personal blog. If you want to change your profile for all of these services, that too is decentralized: you simply change the settings on your Facebook account. OpenID is a chance to make the Web and its services more easily accessible. There are reasonable risks and concerns involved, but also many opportunities.\n\nFacebook announced in 2007 that it would implement OpenID, and others followed, which explains why we now find more and more buttons that say “Connect with Facebook” or “Google Friend Connect.” This leads us to our second plug-in, <a href=\"http://www.sociable.es/facebook-connect/\">Facebook Connect WordPress plug-in</a>, which almost seamlessly integrates Facebook into your blog.\n\nThe plug-in allows users to comment on a blog using their Facebook account; and if they are already signed in or on Facebook, they need not sign in again. Users do not have to register for a unique account on the blog because the plug-in retrieves the user’s information directly from the Facebook API. With access to the user profiles on Facebook, you can display your users’ profile pictures, which adds a personal touch to your blog.\n\nThe plug-in integrates a lot of Facebook functions: for example, users can send invitations and share stories and comments on Facebook, which gives your blog the benefit of word-of-mouth marketing. To do this, you need to activate the plug-in option that publishes a user’s activity in their respective activity feed. Last but not least, you can enable a gadget that displays the profile pictures of your blog’s most recent visitors, similar to “Google Friend Connect.”\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-sociable-example.png\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-sociable-example.png\" alt=\"Facebook Connect Implementation as seen on Sociable.es\" width=\"317\" height=\"337\" /></a>\n\n<em>Facebook Connect implemented on sociable.es (in Spanish)</em>\n\nThis plug-in essentially does the opposite of Wordbook (which integrates Facebook functionality into your blog).\n<h4>Plug-In Installation and Configuration</h4>\nAgain, as in the previous section, you will need to create a new Facebook application.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-new-application.png\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-new-application.png\" alt=\"Create a new Facebook Application\" width=\"745\" height=\"241\" /></a>\n\n<em>Creating a new Facebook application. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-new-application.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nYou will also have to define the callback URLs, which point to the root of your blog.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-callback-url.png\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-callback-url.png\" alt=\"Defining callback URLs for the new application\" width=\"745\" height=\"241\" /></a>\n\n<em>Defining callback URLs for the new application. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-api-callback-url.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nAgain, most of the work is now done, and you can soon start having fun and being creative. Just a few steps remain. First, download the plug-in from the website (see link above) and upload and enable it. A big part of the plug-in consists of the “Facebook Connect” library, which is provided by Facebook. You might stumble over the two <em>xd_reciever</em> files, one in HTML and one in PHP. They play a key role: enabling the so-called <strong>cross-domain communication</strong> (hence, the <em>xd</em>) between your blog and Facebook.\n\nSo why are these needed? Typically, HTTP requests are sent with the <strong>XMLHttpRequest</strong> object. However, the typical security settings on browsers allow XMLHttpRequest to send requests only to the domain where the original request was sent to. In our case, requests are send to and from Facebook. This cross-domain communication is achieved with <strong>iFrame cross-domain communication</strong>. With this, the application opens an iFrame on facebook.com with the relevant requests; for example, to retrieve information on whether a user is logged into Facebook.\n\nThese requests are sent to Facebook through the iFrame via the URL, with which the iFrame is opened. The request is checked, and now the Facebook script that was called via the iFrame opens an iFrame on the application page, where the outcome of the request is sent to, again with the query string of the URL. The result of any requests lands in the query string of the <em>xd_receiver.htm</em> file on your own server. This circumvents the problem of being unable to use XMLHttpRequest.\n\nNow back to the plug-in. Once you have installed and activated the plug-in, you can add the plug-in as a widget to your blog’s sidebar. However, you first need to enter your API key and secret.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-1.png\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-1.png\" alt=\"Settings for Facebook Connect WordPress plug-in\" width=\"656\" height=\"566\" /></a>\n\n<em>Settings for Facebook Connect WordPress plug-in. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-1.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nAs you will see, a whole lot of options are enabled by default, such as automatically publishing comments if they are posted through a Facebook account (the rationale being that you don’t have to moderate them because they come from actual people using Facebook and not spambots).\n\nIf you activate the sharing function, the plug-in adds a “Share” button automatically below each post. You can also activate the option that publishes a user’s comments in their activity feed on Facebook, thus making their activity on your blog visible to their friends.\n\nAfter you have adjusted the settings, you will be notified that you need to define templates for the presentation. These need to be “synchronized” with Facebook. Scroll down a bit to generate and activate these templates. You can change the language manually here as well.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-2.png\"><img src=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-2.png\" alt=\"Alter Facebook Connect template settings\" width=\"750\" height=\"566\" /></a>\n\n<em>Adjust Facebook Connect’s template settings. <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-2.png\">Large view</a>.</em>\n\nThe first template controls how a user’s activity is posted in their activity feed on Facebook. However, you can also include the activity feed of your users in your gadget, as done on sociable.es (see link above). The last step is to go to the widget set-up page and include the gadget as a widget in your sidebar.\n\n<a href=\"http://media1.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-3.png\"><img src=\"http://media2.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/wp-facebook-connect-settings-3.png\" alt=\"Including the Facebook Connect Widget into the sidebar\" width=\"386\" height=\"491\" /></a>\n\n<em>Including the Facebook Connect widget in the sidebar</em>\n\nHere again, you have some choice over the configuration, especially with regard to changing the language, showing a big or small “Connect to Facebook” button, etc. After installing the plug-in, you may want to see what else you can do with it. The implementation on sociable.es is quite a nice one.\n<h3>Further Resources</h3>\nThese two plug-ins are quite specific in what they do. However, a wide variety of Facebook plug-ins are available for platforms other WordPress. Here is a list, certainly not comprehensive:\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://plugins.movabletype.org/facebook-connect-commenters/\">Movable Type</a>\nA plug-in by Six Apart for adding Facebook Connect to a Movable Type blog, allowing any Facebook user to sign in.

In the long run, a more thorough documentation will save you time.\n\nBuilding on the <a href=\"http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/help-file-template/\">Help File Template</a> by Jeffrey, I’ve put together an HTML version to step it up a notch.\n\n<span id=\"more-2277\"> </span>\n<h3>The Help File Template</h3>\nBack in October, Jeffrey put together a basic <a href=\"http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/help-file-template/\">help file</a> text document to serve as a template for Theme Forest authors. I see it used all the time which is great because it’s simple and functional. More and more frequently however, I see authors using new types of documentation that really add extra value and sometimes functionality for buyers.\n\nSo, having seen lots of great documentation files, I thought I would put together a <a href=\"http://themeforest.s3.amazonaws.com/108_helpFile/Template.zip\">basic HTML/CSS documentation template</a> for our authors to start with.\n<h3>The New Help File Template</h3>\nI went with an HTML/CSS format because it can be viewed by anyone with a browser (PDF’s and Videos might require extra software for the buyer to view), it offers additional functionality to make navigating and reading the information easier and authors can more easily demonstrate template features and how to’s.\n\nThe template uses the Blueprint CSS framework and keeps to Jeffrey’s original help file structure.\n<div><a href=\"http://themeforest.s3.amazonaws.com/108_helpFile/Template.zip\">\n<img src=\"http://themeforest.s3.amazonaws.com/108_helpFile/images/template.png\" alt=\"Help File Template v2\" />\n</a></div>\n<h3>What To Do</h3>\nOne of the most common reasons template submissions are rejected is for inadequate documentation. If you use this template and only change a few things, it won’t be enough.\n<ul>\n	<li>Expand upon the sections listed with appropriate information.</li>\n	<li>Provide code examples.</li>\n	<li>Include source file links (for files like jQuery plugins).</li>\n	<li>Provide image examples.</li>\n	<li>Cover the general structure of the HTML and CSS files.</li>\n</ul>\nRemember that your template documentation is supposed to provide information on your work, the features you’ve included and anything out of the ordinary that a buyer might need to know. Feel free to customize the template to look prettier but remember to keep it simple and clean, it is a document for help and information.\n<h3>What Not To Do</h3>\nAs Jeffrey said in the first version, you aren’t writing a novel. Your job isn’t to teach buyers how to code, script or design. If you don’t use this template, stick with Jeffrey’s text file or use a common format such as PDF. Don’t use .doc, .docx or other proprietary file formats.\n<h3><a href=\"http://themeforest.s3.amazonaws.com/108_helpFile/Template.zip\">Download</a></h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>Please subscribe to the <a title=\"ThemeForest RSS Feed\" href=\"http://feedproxy.google.com/themeforest\">Theme Forest RSS Feed</a>, and follow us on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/themeforest\">Twitter</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>','aa-Building Better Template Documentation','','publish','open','open','','building-better-template-documentation','','','2009-02-06 01:06:02','2009-02-06 01:06:02','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?p=35',0,'post','',0),(39,1,'2009-02-28 01:11:07','2009-02-28 01:11:07','<ul>\n	<li>No Category</li>\n	<li>1 Tag</li>\n	<li>No Comments or Trackbacks</li>\n	<li>Embedded Video</li>\n</ul>\nOriginal Post: <a href=\"http://blog.wordpress.tv/2009/01/16/welcome-to-wordpresstv/\">http://blog.wordpress.tv/2009/01/16/welcome-to-wordpresstv/</a>\n<h3><strong>Our goal with WordPress.tv is simple: </strong></h3>\nTo make it easy for you to find up-to-date,  WordPress-themed video content within a couple of clicks.

A blog that shares what you know, to help others. Even--or <em>especially</em>--if that means giving away your \"secrets\". Teaching people to do what <em>you</em> do is one of the best ways we know to grow an audience--an audience of users you want to help.\n\nIt\'s what I try to do here because--let\'s face it--<em>you\'re just not that into me</em> ; ) But I assume (since you\'re reading this blog) that you ARE into helping your users kick ass. So to make content that\'s worth your time and attention, I try to make this a learning blog. I reckon y\'all could not care less what I had for dinner, who I ate with, or what I think about the latest headlines.\n\nSo, as promised in an earlier post, here\'s a crash course on some of our favorite learning techniques gleaned from cognitive science, learning theory, neuroscience, psychology, and entertainment (including game design). Much of it is based around courses I designed and taught at UCLA Extension\'s New Media/Entertainment Studies department. This is the long version, and my next post will be just the bullet points with the pictures--as a kind of quick visual summary.\n\nThis is <em>not</em> a comprehensive look at the state of learning theory today, but it does include almost everything we think about in creating our books. And although it\'s geared toward blogs/writing virtually everything in here applies regardless of how you deliver the learning--you can easily adapt it to prentations, user documentation, or classroom learning. And remember, this is a BLOG, so don\'t expect academic rigor ; ) but I do have references, so leave a comment if there\'s something in particular you want.\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Crash Course in Learning Theory</h3>\nThe long version...\n<strong>• Talk to the brain first, mind second.</strong><img style=\"margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;\" title=\"Brain_3\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/brain_3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Brain_3\" />\nEven if a learner is personally motivated to learn a topic, if the learning content itself isn\'t motivating, the learner\'s brain will do everything possible to look for something more interesting. This applies to both <em>getting</em> and <em>keeping</em> attention, as well as memory. Remember, you can\'t do anything until you get past the brain\'s crap filter! And to the brain, a dry, dull, academic explanation is definitely CRAP (regardless of how much your <em>mind</em> cares about the topic).\n<strong>Learning is not a one-way \"push\" model.</strong>\n<img title=\"Learningnotoneway\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/learningnotoneway.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Learningnotoneway\" />\nLearners are not \"empty vessels\" waiting to be filled with content pushed into it by an expert, blogger, author, etc. Learning is something that happens between the learner\'s ears--it\'s a form of co-creation between the learner and the learning experience. You can\'t <em>create</em> new pathways in someone\'s head... your job is to create an environment where the chances of the learner \"getting it\" in the way that you intend are as high as possible.\n\n<strong>• Provide a meaningful benefit for each topic, in the form of \"why you should care about this\" scenario.</strong>\nLearning is much more effective if the learner\'s brain knows why what you\'re about to talk about matters. The benefit and/or reason why you should learn something needs to come <em>before</em> the actual content. Otherwise, the learner\'s brain gets to the end of what you\'re telling them and says, \"Oh, NOW you tell me. If you\'d said that earlier, I would have paid more attention...\" This process of not-paying-attention is not completely within the learner\'s conscious control so, like I said, even if the person is motivated to learn this thing, their brain can still tune out during specific parts that don\'t start with a compelling benefit.\n\nTo find a \"meaningful benefit\", play the \"Why? Who Cares? So What?\" game with someone else. Describe the thing you\'re trying to explain, to which the other person asks, \"Why?\" Provide an answer, to which the person then asks, \"Who cares?\". Provide an answer, to which the person asks, \"So?\" At this point, when you\'re nearly ready to kill them for <em>not getting it</em>, you probably have the thing you should have said <em>instead</em> of whatever you said first (and second). The most compelling and motivating reason/benefit is almost always the thing you say only after you\'ve answered at least three \"Yeah, but WHY do I care?\" questions.\n<strong>• Use visuals! </strong>\n<img title=\"Picturesandwordschart\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/picturesandwordschart.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Picturesandwordschart\" />\nWe are all visual creatures, and the brian can process visual information far more efficiently than words. These pictures can come in many forms:\n* Info graphic or diagram\n* Visual metaphor\n* Picture of the thing being described, with annotations\n* Picture of the end state\n* Picture designed to create attention and recall\n<strong>• Use redundancy to increase understanding and retention.</strong>\n<img title=\"Redundancy\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/redundancy.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Redundancy\" />\nRedundancy doesn\'t mean <em>repetition</em>--it means \"say the same thing again, but differently.\" And \"differently\" can mean:\n* From a different <em>perspective</em>.\n* Using a different information channel (channels include things like Graphics, Examples, Prose explanations, step-by-step instruction/tutorial, case studies, exercises, summaries, bullet points, commentary, devil\'s advocate, Q &amp; A, personal POV, etc.)\n\nAlso, <strong>the more senses you engage, the greater the potential for retention and recall.</strong> Even having a bowl of just-popped popcorn or the smell of freshly-baked cookies while learning, can make a difference. Bummer about web-delivered content, though...\n\nBeing terse is good for a reference document, but deadly in learning content. The best learning experience considers the way you\'d learn that particular thing in real life -- but offers it in a safe, simulated, compressed form. Real-life learning is never terse; it\'s choas and confusion punctuated with moments of insight (\"Ah-ha!\") and clarity. It\'s a wave, not a straight line. A learning blog, book, or classroom shouldn\'t try to straighten it out!\n<strong>• Maintain interest with variety and surprise.</strong>\n<img title=\"Surpriselearning_1\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/surpriselearning_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Surpriselearning_1\" />\n<strong>• Use conversational language. </strong>\n<img title=\"Conversationalwords\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/conversationalwords.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Conversationalwords\" />\nThe brain pays more attention when it thinks it\'s in a conversation and must \"hold up its end.\" And there\'s evidence that suggests your brain behaves this way even if the \"conversation\" is between a human (you) and a book or computer screen (or lecture).\n<strong>• Use mistakes, failures, and counter-intuitive WTF?</strong>\n<img title=\"Wtfgirl\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/wtfgirl.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Wtfgirl\" />\nPeople usually learn much more from failures than from being shown everything working correctly or as expected.\nThe most memorable learning experiences are usually those where things are going along fine, making sense, etc. when you suddenly slam into something that goes terribly wrong. Describing the things that do NOT work is often more effective than showing how things DO work. (We call this the \"WTF learning principle\").\n\nBut <em>showing</em> is even better than <em>describing</em>. And even better than <em>showing</em> is <em>letting the learner experience.</em> Take the learner down a garden path where everything makes perfect sense until it explodes. They are far more likely to remember than if you simply say, \"Oh, and be sure you do it such and such a way.\"\n\nIt\'s tempting to want to <em>protect</em> the learners from the bumps and scrapes experienced in the real world, but in many cases (with many topics) you aren\'t doing the learner any favors.\n<strong>• Use the filmaker (and novelist) principle of SHOW-don\'t-TELL.</strong>\nRather than lecture about the details of how something works, let them experience how it works by walking them through a story or scenario, where they can feel the bumps along the way.\n<strong>• Use \"chunking\" to reduce cognitive overhead.</strong>\nRemember, we have very little short-term memory (RAM) in our heads. The standard rule is that we can hold roughly 7 things before we must either commit some of it to long-term storage or toss it out to take in something new. And the things you hold in short-term memory vanish as soon as there is an interruption. You look up a phone number, and as long as you repeat it to yourself and <em>nobody asks you a question</em>, you can remember it--usually just long enough to dial the number. By the time you finish talking to the person on the other end of the line, the number is long gone.\n\nChunking takes fine-grained data/facts/knowledge and puts them into meaningful or at least <em>memorable</em> chunks to help reduce the number of things you have to hold in short-term memory, and increase the chance of retention and recall. For example, imagine you were asked to take 30 seconds to memorize the following \"code symbols\" for the numbers 1-10:\n\n<img title=\"Chunkingbad\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/chunkingbad.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Chunkingbad\" />\nyou\'d be lucky to get 60% correct in a follow-up quiz given immediately after those 30 seconds. There are simply too many symbols to memorize in such a short time, and there\'s no instantly obvious way to relate them to one another.\n\nBut... with one simple change to the way in which the symbols are presented--and without changing the symbols:\n<img title=\"Chunkinggood\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/chunkinggood.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Chunkinggood\" />\n\n30 seconds gets most people to 100% accuracy in the follow-up quiz. In other words, by grouping the symbols into a meaningful, memorable pattern, we reduce the number of individual (and potentially arbitrary) things you have to memorize, and increase the chances.\n<img style=\"margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;\" title=\"Relax\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/relax.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Relax\" />\n<strong>• Since stress/anxiety can <em>reduce</em> focus and memory, do everything possible to make the learner feel relaxed and confident. </strong>\nThat does not mean dumbing-down the material, but rather letting the learner know that -- \"This IS confusing -- so don\'t worry if it\'s still a little fuzzy at this point. It will start to come together once you\'ve worked through the rest of the examples.\" In other words, let them know that they aren\'t stupid for not getting it at this point. For especially difficult and complex topics, let the learner know where they should be at each stage, and help them decide whether they need to go back and repeat something. Make sure they know that this repetition is part of the normal learning process, not something they must do because they failed.\n\nIf you\'re worried about being patronizing, then <em>don\'t patronize</em>. Just be honest about what it takes for people to learn that content. But you can\'t do that unless you <em>know</em> how hard it is for a beginner to learn it. As experts, we have a tough time remembering what it was like NOT TO KNOW, so if you\'re not sure, do the research. One of the best ways to find out what newcomers struggle with is to visit online discussion forums for beginners in your topic. This is also a great way to come up with a table-of-contents or topic list, because what you THINK should be a no-brainer might be the one thing everyone gets stuck on, and what you think would be confusing could turn out to be easy for most people.\n\nThe point is, YOU are not necessarily the best judge of how your audience will learn the topic. And empathy rarely helps -- you cannot truly put yourself in someone else\'s shoes unless their brain and background are a very close match for yours. You have to find out what your learners are struggling with, and suspend any judgement about \"This <em>should</em> be a no-brainer.\"\n\nThose who have <em>taught</em> a topic have a big advantage writing about it--they\'ve fielded the questions and watched people struggle. <strong>They know how things should be \"weighted\" according to how difficult they are.</strong> But you can learn almost as much simply by lurking on beginner discussion forums (or attending user group sessions for newbies).\n<strong>• Use seduction, charm, mystery to build <em>curiosity</em></strong>.\n<img title=\"Seductioncuriosity\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/seductioncuriosity.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Seductioncuriosity\" />\nWe\'re hard-wired to pay attention and pursue things we\'re attracted to. This isn\'t about selling them on an idea--it\'s about helping them stay engaged and <em>learning</em>. Knowing what--and when--to <em>withold</em> is one of the most powerful tools you have. If you\'re writing <em>reference</em> material (like this post), witholding will just piss people off. But in a learning experience, you want a page-turner. And don\'t even <em>think</em> about suggesting that \"page-turner\" doesn\'t apply to, say, technical material. If the purpose is learning, the learner has to stay engaged. It\'s up to you to craft an experience that keeps them hooked. This engagement might be within a <em>single</em> post, or you might offer little cliffhangers or teasers to keep them engaged across multiple posts, if that\'s what it takes to cover a topic.\n<strong>• Use a spiral model to keep users engaged</strong>.\n<img title=\"Spiralexperiencemodel_2\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/spiralexperiencemodel_2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Spiralexperiencemodel_2\" />\nGame developers know the importance of \"The Next Level\", and learning experiences must do the same. Each iteration through the spiral should start with a meaningful, motivating goal, followed by the interaction/activity/reading that moves you toward that goal, followed by a meaningful payoff. Ideally, the \"meaningful payoff\" leads right into the next motivating goal.\n\nFor example, in a game the payoff for completing a level might be \"You Get A New Weapon\". But now that you <em>have</em> that new weapon, here\'s the cool new thing you can do that you couldn\'t do before. Learning doesn\'t need to be any different. \"Imagine you want to do X on your website...\" is the goal that starts the topic, but when the topic is complete, the learning content can say, \"Now that you have THAT new [superpower capability], wouldn\'t it be cool if you could do Y?\" And off they go into the next round of learning.\n<img title=\"Nextlevel_1\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/nextlevel_1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Nextlevel_1\" />\n<strong>• Don\'t rob the learner of the opportunity to think</strong>!\n<img title=\"Opportunitytothink\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/opportunitytothink.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Opportunitytothink\" />\nRather than simply spelling everything out step by step, ask questions, pose multiple and potentially conflicting viewpoints, show the topic from different perspectives, and set up scenarios (and possibly exercises) that allow the learner to use deeper brain processing. Things that encourage deeper thinking are those that cause the learner to categorize, organize, apply, infer, evaluate, etc. Don\'t be afraid to pose questions that you don\'t answer right away.\n\nThink back to those teachers you had who would ask a question then immediately answer it, as opposed to those who would answer a question then just sit there... waiting...\n<strong>• Use the 80/20 principle to reduce cognitive overload. </strong>\n<img style=\"margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;\" title=\"8020chartsmall\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/8020chartsmall.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"8020chartsmall\" />\nIt\'s far more important that they <em>nail</em> the <em>key</em> things than be <em>exposed</em> to <em>everything</em>. Be brutal, be brave, be relentless in what you leave out. Knowing what NOT to include is more important in learning design than knowing what TO include.\n<strong>• Context matters. </strong>\nTry to place facts, concepts, procedures, examples in a bigger context. Even if you\'ve already discussed the context, don\'t be afraid to repeat that context again. For example, instead of always showing code snippets, show the code within the larger context of where it usually appears. Highlight the code you\'re focused on by bolding it, putting it in a box, etc., so that the learner is not overwhelmed by the amount of code, and can focus on just the part you\'re talking about, but still be able to see how that new code relates to the rest of the code. Our rule of thumb in our books is to show the same code context two or three times before switching to just the snippets (although this rule varies greatly with the type of code).\n<strong>• Emotion matters! </strong>\n<img title=\"Shockedface\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/shockedface.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shockedface\" />\nPeople learn and remember that which they FEEL. Look back at what you\'ve written and if it\'s dry and lifeless, try to inject some energy. Dry, academic, formal, lecture-style writing is usually the WORST form of learning content.\n\nOne of the many ways to help tap into emotions (and increase attention and memory) is to use the brain\'s reaction to <em>faces</em>. Almost any kind of face with a strong expression evokes a part of the brain reserved <em>just</em> for processing faces. The ability to accurately recognize faces and read facial expressions is a key element of survival for the brain...\n<img title=\"Facesmad\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/facesmad.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Facesmad\" />\n<img title=\"Babypicface\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/babypicface.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Babypicface\" />\n<strong>• Never underestimate the power of FUN to keep people engaged.</strong>\n<img title=\"Havingfun\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/havingfun.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Havingfun\" />\nThe act of having fun is also an emotion, so anything associated with fun has a greater chance of being remembered.\n<strong>• Use stories.</strong>\nHumans have been learning from stories for, well, <em>a really really really long time</em>. Millenia longer than we\'ve been learning from lectures on just the data and information. When we say \"stories\", we don\'t necessarily mean actual fictional \"John\'s network went down just as he was plugging in the...\", although those do work. But a \"story\" can simply mean that you\'re asking the learner to imagine herself wanting to do a particular thing, and then offering an experience of what that would be like if she were actually trying to accomplish it, with all the ups, downs, false leads, etc. (but again, with less of the actual pain she might experience in real life). A flight simulator, for example, is a kind of story.You aren\'t just up there learning the controls; you\'re actually <em>flying</em> in a particular storyline.\n\nIf you\'re a software developer, another way to think about story-driven learning is to map use-cases to learning stories. Base your learning content around individual use-cases, and put the learner in the center of the use-case. One easy trick for designing story-driven learning is to start each topic with something like, \"Imagine you want to do...\" and then walk though that experience. It makes the learning organic and real, and helps make sure you get rid of the stuff that doesn\'t need to be there. If it doesn\'t show up in a use-case/story, are you so sure you should be teaching it?\n<strong>• Use pacing and vary the parts of the brain you\'re exercising.</strong>\n<img title=\"Timingandpacing\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/timingandpacing.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Timingandpacing\" />\nLearning--and especially <em>memorization</em>--doesn\'t happen at an even pace. Brains--or especially <em>parts</em> of brains--get tired and lose focus. By varying the pace--and type--of learning content, you give a user\'s brain the chance to let one part rest while the other part takes over. For example, follow a heavy left-brain technical procedure with a big-picture example/story that covers the same topic. This helps the learner\'s memory in two different ways--the redundancy means two different chances to save the information, and the fact that you gave one part of the brain a break while shifting to a different part keeps their brain working longer without fatigue.\n\nThink about it--if you hopped up and down on your right foot repeatedly, that right leg would give up after fewer repetitions than if you kept switching from right to left. Pacing--by frequently switching which parts of your body (or in this case, brain) you\'re using--lets you stay fresher for a longer period.\n\nAlso, recording something to long-term memory is rarely <em>instant</em> (although the stronger the associated emotion, the faster (and more likely) your brain is to record it). Memory is a physical/chemical process that happens <em>after</em> you\'ve been exposed to something, and if anything interrupts the process, the memory is not stored. That\'s why people with serious head injuries often cannot remember what took place just prior to the injury--the process of recording those things to long-term memory was stopped.\n\nIf you want someone to <em>remember</em> something, you must give them a chance to process that memory. Relentlessly presenting new, tough information (like tons of code and complex concepts) without also including chances to reflect, process, think, apply, review, etc. virtually guarantees that much of the learning will be forgotten.\n<strong>• Remember, it\'s never about <em>you</em>. It\'s about how <em>the learner feels about himself</em> as a result of the learning experience. </strong>\n<img title=\"Notaboutyou\" src=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/notaboutyou.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Notaboutyou\" />\nDon\'t use learning content as a chance to show off your knowledge--that virtually guarantees your content won\'t be user-friendly. Use it as a chance to help someone\'s life a little.\nA successful learning blog is about helping the readers learn and grown and kick ass! Make that happen, and your stats will take care of themselves. In contrast, the best way to ensure a <em>low </em>readership is to assume that readers are into <em>you</em>. Offering users nothing but your opinions, however well-reasoned, might not be enough to make it worth their scarce time and attention.\n\n\"If you teach it, they will come.\"','aa-Crash course in learning theory','Even if a learner is personally motivated to learn a topic, if the learning content itself isn\'t motivating, the learner\'s brain will do everything possible to look for something more interesting. This applies to both getting and keeping attention, as well as memory. Remember, you can\'t do anything until you get past the brain\'s crap filter! And to the brain, a dry, dull, academic explanation is definitely CRAP (regardless of how much your mind cares about the topic).','publish','open','open','','crash-course-in-learning-theory','','','2009-03-06 01:23:05','2009-03-06 01:23:05','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?p=47',0,'post','',0),(54,1,'2009-03-28 13:17:47','2009-03-28 13:17:47','<ul>\n	<li> Code Samples</li>\n</ul>\nOriginal Article: <a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/2009/03/html/compass-960-semantics\">http://blog.carbonfive.com/2009/03/html/compass-960-semantics</a>\n<h3>My problem: Grid layouts – crazy, sexy, cool. Presentation classes in my semantic markup – neither sexy nor cool, and arguably crazy.</h3>\nThese days I can’t help but notice a burgeoning awareness regarding seasoned typographical principles and practices and lively discussions around the best way to bring these ideas and procedures to bear in the realm of web design. One area of these discussions that dovetails with my own interests is the subject of grid layouts. Grid systems are the architectonic foundation of a well structured and holistically interrelated design. They originated during the reign of the International Typographic Style, a primarily Swiss graphic arts movement which occurred after World War II. Grid layouts were cultivated and matured in the hands of such legendary designers as  Emil Ruder and Josef Müller-Brockmann, acknowledged masters of simultaneously presenting information in a functional and stylistic manner. As web designers, I feel we should constantly strive for these same goals – the presentation of information in a readily understandable way, yet also striving for an elegance in our presentation. Grids can help us accomplish this goal.\n\nOver the past few years much headway has been made in cultivating an online consciousness of Grid Systems. <a title=\"Koi Vinh\'s on grid layouts\" href=\"http://www.subtraction.com/2004/12/31/grid-computi\">Khoi Vinh</a> and <a title=\"Cameron Moll on grid layouts\" href=\"http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2006/12/gridding_the_960/\">Cameron Moll</a> have shown us the benefits of using grid systems for web layouts, and Antonio Carusone from <a href=\"http://www.aisleone.net\">AisleOne</a> has recently pieced together the awesome grid oriented hub, <a title=\"The Grid System\" href=\"http://www.thegridsystem.org/\">The Grid System</a>. Further, a number of CSS based grid frameworks have been popping up on the scene. Those that have much traction in the blogosphere–Blueprint, YUI Grids, 960 grid system–are only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI’ve been interested in experimenting with one of these frameworks for a while, but I have a single nagging concern with the way they are structured. All of the frameworks I have looked at use CSS class definitions which possess names that reek of presentational concerns. For example, Blueprint requires class names like “span-7 last” or “span-8″; 960 favors the equally presentational “grid_1 prefix_1″ or “grid_7 alpha.” I just can’t get on board with this approach. I’m a firm adherent to notions of lean, minimal, and semantically vaible (X)HTML markup. The web development community has made great strides in separating out presentational concerns from the meaning inherent in well-crafted (X)HTML, divorcing the two orthogonal axes of style and semantics. And while I am a firm believer in the power of the grid to unify these two axes, as has been so well exhibited in the world of print, I cannot support said unification if it comes at the cost of reintroducing presentational markers into our markup – even something as ostensibly innocuous as a ‘mere’ presentational class.\n\nSo, where does that leave us? Is it possible to get the best of both worlds? Can we simultaneously develop semantic markup while leveraging those tried and true grid layout principles common enough to be packaged into a framework?\n<h3>A potential solution to my problem: Compass – crazy? sexy? cool? To be determined…</h3>\nMuch to my pleasure, I am alone in neither my conviction nor my desire. Enter Compass, a ruby based application which provides Sass based APIs to many of the most prominent CSS frameworks, including those concerned with providing grid layouts. Compass sits on top of Sass, a domain specific language (DSL) for programmatically crafting CSS. The power of Sass derives from the fact that it is a real programming language, replete with all the benefits of such a thing: pragmatic tools such variable declarations, control structures, and method invocations, as well as more theoretical, but no less useful, concepts like abstraction, DRY-ness, encapsulation, modularity, and code re-use. I’ll admit, I’m new to Sass, having used it only superficially on a small work project. I have barely scratched the surface of its capabilities. And while some feel its application <a href=\"http://fecklessmind.com/2009/01/28/fuck-sass/\">fails</a> when applied to large scale projects, I can’t help but favor the programmatic benefits Sass brings to the table given my software engineering background.\n\nArmed with Sass, developers can effectively write small libraries of code which will ultimately be translated into CSS. And Compass provides them with a mechanism for collecting these Sass libraries together and incorporating multiple APIs to into their own projects.\n<h4>So, how does Compass help preserve semantic markup?</h4>\nOne of Sass’s most compelling features is known as a ‘mixin’. A mixin is a small module of Sass code, <em>defined but once</em>, that can be included into a Sass file and then referenced throughout. You can see where this is going. Imagine that in your application’s Sass file, you can gain access to, for example, 960’s grid layout API. You can ‘mixin’ these snippets of Sass code <em>directly into your own semantic class definitions</em> forgoing the need to use 960’s presentational class names anywhere in your (X)HTML. In short, Compass grants you the power to marry a tightly structured grid-layout with the beauty of lean, semantic markup. Pretty nifty, no?\n\nSo I decided to put all this to the test. I needed to learn more Sass, I wanted to play with the 960 grid system, and I wanted to vet Compass’s claim that it can help you eat a grid-layout cake iced with sugary semantic goodness. Follow along if you will…\n<h3>Sussin’ the Solution: My first Compass-960 project</h3>\n<h4>Installing Compass and the 960 plug-in</h4>\nSince I already had Ruby and RubyGems installed, I was ready to start straight away with the installation of Compass.\n\nFirst, I installed the bleeding edge of Haml, which includes Sass:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ git clone git:<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">//</span>github.com<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>nex3<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>haml.git\n$ <span style=\"color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;\">cd</span> haml\n$ rake <span style=\"color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;\">install</span></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nI verified my Sass installation:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ sass <span style=\"color: #660033;\">-v</span>\nHaml 2.1.0</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nGood to go. Next, I installed Compass and the 960 plug-in:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ gem <span style=\"color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;\">install</span> chriseppstein-compass\n$ gem <span style=\"color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;\">install</span> chriseppstein-compass-<span style=\"color: #000000;\">960</span>-plugin</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h4>Creating a Compass-960 website project</h4>\nTime to create a template Compass-960 project:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ compass <span style=\"color: #660033;\">-r</span> ninesixty <span style=\"color: #660033;\">-f</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">960</span> the_obscurantist</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nNow I had my template project, which comprised:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ <span style=\"color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;\">find</span> the_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>config.rb\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>src\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>src<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>grid.sass\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>src<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>text.sass\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>stylesheets\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>stylesheets<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>grid.css\nthe_obscurantist<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>stylesheets<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>text.css</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nOut of the box, the 960 plug-in produced two Sass files, grid.sass and text.sass. These two files mirrored the CSS files that come with the 960 framework, 960.css and text.css respectively. Whe I inspected the *.sass files, I noticed they already contained  code to get me up and running with a basic 960 grid layout.\n\nAt this point I took some time to finagle things into a state commensurate with my overall goal – the elimination of 960’s presentational class names. First, I wasn’t interested in 960’s typography, so I ditched text.sass and text.css. Second, I also ditched grid.sass and grid.css, because those files provide access to styles designated with presentational class names, for example: ‘.container_12′, ‘.grid_4′, etc. Next, as learning exercise, I converted my variation on Eric Meyer’s CSS reset to Sass. Finally, I set up an application.sass file, being sure to include the 960 API and Compass’s clearfix module.\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"css\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #a1a100;\">@import compass/utilities/general/clearfix.sass</span>\n<span style=\"color: #a1a100;\">@import 960/grid.sass</span></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nOk, cool. I had some Sass files, but where were my CSS files? Simply enough, I had to run Compass to generate them.\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ compass\n   exists stylesheets\n  compile src<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>application.sass\nidentical stylesheets<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>application.css\n  compile src<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>reset.sass\nidentical stylesheets<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>reset.css</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nManually regenerating your CSS files everytime you make a change is burdensome. Compass can be run as a process that detects changes to your source files and automatically regenerates your css. I’ve found that leaving this process running in its own shell is useful so I can keep an eye on the Sass log for parsing errors.\n\nSo I ran compass as a daemon to forgo manual re-generation:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ compass <span style=\"color: #660033;\">--watch</span></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nGreat. Setting up a basic Compass project went off with out a hitch. I added in the remaining requisite files — an index page and the jQuery javascript library — and was ready to… Oh wait, what am I building?!\n<h4>Using 960’s handy design resources to brainstorm ‘The Obscurantist’ daily newspaper</h4>\nBecause my whole endeavor was motivated by an intuitive yearning for transparent and easily interpretable semantic information, I decided to tip a hat to my favorite muse, Bittersweet Irony, and design a newspaper that had but one purpose – proffering the opaque and the impenetrable. Enter, The Obscurantist! As newspapers traditionally adhere to very strict grid layouts, the Obscurantist would allow me to learn the basics of the 960 framework.\n\nIn my view, some of the most useful resources provided by the 960 framework are the sketchsheets and grid templates. The sketchsheets were great for quickly thumbnailing rough ideas.\n\nHere’s an example of a sketchsheet, marred only by my attempt at artistic expression:\n<div id=\"attachment_362\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/obscurantist_sketch.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-362\" title=\"obscurantist_sketch\" src=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/obscurantist_sketch.jpg\" alt=\"Example usage of the 960 frameworks 16-grid sketchsheet\" width=\"300\" height=\"218\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example usage of the 960 framework</p>\n\n</div>\n16 columns was overkill, so I decided to fire up Illustrator and utilize 960’s Illustrator 12-column grid template as a background layer to help me lay out my page design. (960 comes with a range of templates catering to the most prominent graphics programs.)\n\nHere’s the final design:\n<div id=\"attachment_380\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 310px;\"><a href=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ai-960-layout.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-380\" title=\"ai-960-layout\" src=\"http://blog.carbonfive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ai-960-layout.png\" alt=\"The Obscurantist Illustrator layout using a 960 template file as background layer\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Obscurantist Illustrator layout using a 960 template file as background layer</p>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Mark It Up</h4>\nThe next step was converting my design to semantic and valid XHTML. This post is already long enough, so I won’t bore you with the details. Suffice it to say, I tried my best not to let presentational concerns influence my markup. By keeping things as semantic as possible, I set the stage for seeing how well Compass would facilitate leveraging 960’s layout structure in spite of the framework’s presentational class names. Feel free to pop open firebug and check out the <a title=\"The Obscurantist: An example Compass-960 layout\" href=\"http://labs.carbonfive.com/compass_example\">The Obscurantist’s</a> markup for yourself.\n<h4>Stylin’ with Sass, 960 degrees o’ heat, straight sexified son!</h4>\nThe next step was to implement my 12-column grid layout in application.sass. As I had already designed The Obscurantist in Illustrator using the 960 grid template as a backdrop, coding up the grid was very straight forward. It turns out I can count to twelve, so I was in good shape. I’ve included the relevant aspects of application.sass below. Read it over, and below I’ll explain Compass’s 960 API in more detail.\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"css\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #a1a100;\">@import compass/utilities/general/clearfix.sass</span>\n<span style=\"color: #a1a100;\">@import 960/grid.sass</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #808080; font-style: italic;\">/* ...omitted for brevity... */</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#container</span>\n  <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid-container\n  <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>clearfix\n\n  <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.title</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n  <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.publication-info</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.volume</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">2</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>alpha\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.date</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">8</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.number</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">2</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>omega\n\n   <span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#article</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.body</span>\n\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">7</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>alpha\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.captioned-photo</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">5</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>omega\n\n  <span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#sidebar</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n    img\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">5</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>alpha\n    <span style=\"color: #6666ff;\">.body</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">7</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n      <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>omega\n\n  <span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#tagline</span>\n\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">12</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n	<li> ‘+grid-container’ establishes the overall 960px wide centered layout</li>\n	<li> ‘+grid(m, n)’ assigns an element a width based on the number of columns(m) it should take up with respect to a number of total colums(n)</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Keen readers will notice that while the 960 grid system supports only 12 and 16 column layouts, +grid(m,n) is a method call which supports <strong>any</strong> number of columns. That’s right, Compass provides a <strong>completely customizable</strong> 960 pixel wide layout. The various column widths are calculated when Sass generates your CSS. (More on this below.)</em>\n\nSo what about this ominous sounding “Alpha” and “Omega” business? As it happens, the 960 framework defines a gutter of 20px, each neighboring element contributing a 10 pixel margin to the overall gutter. Therefore, there will be a 10 pixel margin on the left and right hand sides of the overall grid container, constituted by the left side of the first element in a row and the right side of the last element in a row. (Check out <a title=\"The Obscurantist: An example Compass-960 layout\" href=\"http://labs.carbonfive.com/compass_example\">The Obscurantist</a> in Firebug for a better understanding.)\n\nBut, what happens if you are nesting grid elements? In that case you don’t want the child to re-contribute 10 pixels of outside margin, as the parent element already took care of this. What do you do? Simply demarcate the left most nested element as the ‘Alpha’ and the right most nested element as the ‘Omega’. Doing so will remove the outside margins and your grid layout will remain locked in place.\n\nOne additional note, the container element has had a clearfix applied to it, so that it will expand to\n\ncontain its floated child elements. This allowed me to attach 960’s 12-column grid image as a background to ensure my layout exactly matched my mockup.\n<h4>The end has come: Sexiness – attained. Coolness – attained. Craziness – Why not?</h4>\nThe end result – <a title=\"The Obscurantist: An example Compass-960 layout\" href=\"http://labs.carbonfive.com/compass_example\">The Obscurantist</a>. You can toggle the 12-column grid background using the button in the upper right-hand corner.\n\nI’m sold. Compass successfully allowed to me attain my goal: overall clean, minimal, and semantic markup and a rigid adherence to an underlying grid-system.\n\nFinally, the example site is up on github, feel free to peruse it if you need a more comprehensive view of the working parts.\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"bash\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\">$ git clone git:<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">//</span>github.com<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>aaronsbrown<span style=\"color: #000000; font-weight: bold;\">/</span>obscurantist.git</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Final Thoughts and Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n	<li>My background is in server-side software development and therefore the client-side space and its attendant technologies are relatively new to me. Before I experimented with Sass, I took it for granted that styling presentation via CSS was categorically a different process than developing software. But Sass directly counters my assumption. And even though I no longer directly write CSS when coding with Sass, its DSL makes me feel right at home when describing my presentational styles. Most importantly, Sass gives me the ability to bring my software engineering practices to bear in the presentational realm. I can’t help but think this is a big deal.However, I will say getting comfortable with “programmatic” CSS took a bit of mental re-orientation. I was used to having all my style definitions right in front of me, explicit and clear. Yet Sass, especially when coupled with Compass, introduces to the CSS space welcomed notions of abtraction, like modularity and encapsulation. As such, things are no longer directly in front of me. Rather, I have to approach coding CSS with the mindset of using libraries. So i have to fire up the docs (in this case the 960 plug-in Sass code), see what resources the library provides, and then determine the best use of those resources. Again, I go through this process daily when writing application code, but it felt a little awkward when first incorporating this practice in the CSS space. But once I began approaching coding my presentation layer like any other programming task, things immediately fell into place. Also, because the end product of the Sass work cycle is CSS, I had ready access to those files if I wanted want to see what was being sent to the client. And since I use Firebug as my main debugging tool, my approach to debugging the presentation layer didn’t have to change at all.</li>\n	<li>I think that for small personal and professional projects Sass and Compass will help streamline CSS development. The ability to modularize and re-use code is a big win in terms of best practices and efficiency. It can also help maintain consistency throughout the code base. I think the tool would even be useful in large-scale organizations where the developers share similar values and engineering practices, and whom are disciplined enough to learn and use the Sass/Compass libraries.I’m perhaps a bit more skeptical about the promise of Compass to distribute reusable CSS plug-ins throughout larger engineering ecosystems. While there are surely commonplace CSS problems, I think the idiosyncratic nature of website design will at some point outweigh the ability for large scale CSS reuse. But, I do hope I am wrong on this point, as I feel Compass’s aims and values are admirable. Time will tell.</li>\n	<li>There is one big concern I have with respect to using Compass to maintain semantics, and it concerns optimization. The Sass ‘mixin’ model basically inlines style attributes (from, for example, 960) into your own custom CSS. The (potential) downside of this is lots of duplicated CSS rules in Sass’s <em>generated end product</em>. How might this model impact the file size of my custom CSS? And how to weigh this increase in file size against the benefits Sass and Compass bring to the development side of things? Are we sacrificing consumer performance for producer best practices? I don’t have an answer to this question. If anyone out there can speak to this issue, I’d love to hear your thoughts.If I have time, I would like to implement The Obscurantist with only the 960 framework, sans Compass, and compare the resulting CSS. I’ll just have to stomach presentation class names in my markup for the sake of enlightenment.</li>\n	<li>Given the programmatic nature of Sass, the Compass port of the 960 framework is extremely customizable. In effect,you get an API to generate a grid of N columns, each separated by a configurable gutter, that all together span 960 pixels. For example, let’s say you want to create a layout that is 960 px wide and comprises 5 columns separated by 10 pixel gutters. It’s pretty easy:\n<div class=\"wp_syntax\">\n<div class=\"code\">\n<pre class=\"css\" style=\"font-family:monospace;\"><span style=\"color: #a1a100;\">@import 960/grid.sass</span>\n\n!ninesixty_gutter_width <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">=</span> <span style=\"color: #933;\">10px</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#container</span>\n  <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid-container\n  <span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#main-content</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">4</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">5</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span>\n\n  <span style=\"color: #cc00cc;\">#nav</span>\n    <span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">+</span>grid<span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">(</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">1</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">,</span><span style=\"color: #cc66cc;\">5</span><span style=\"color: #00AA00;\">)</span></pre>\n</div>\n</div>\nI encourage you to dig into the 960 plug-in’s Sass files to see what other things you can tweak.</li>\n	<li>More generally, there seems to be a growing number of Compass modules available. Some modules come installed with Compass, while others are available as plug-ins. Therefore, you can pick and choose from various CSS frameworks as the need arises. Say you love 960’s approach to grid layouts but you prefer Blueprint’s typographic standards. Well, Compass allows you to selectively incorporate mixins from both frameworks. And since you don’t have to rely on the frameworks’ class definitions you remain in full control of your semantics.</li>\n	<li>And finally, a few words about the 960 CSS framework. I’ll be honest, when all was said and done, I thought – “All this for some width and margin definitions? I could have come up with that on my own with not much effort. It all seems pretty simple.” But part of me thinks such a reaction reflects, perhaps ironically, rather well on a framework. 960 does one thing-it helps  you execute a grid layout rapidly, easily, and with little preparation. It doesn’t get in your way and simply optimizes and enhances your work-flow. And while it makes grid layouts <em>seem</em> intuitive and transparent, I’m quite sure there are subtleties hidden away that I’m not taking into account with my cursory ascription of, “That seems pretty simple.” So I’m perfectly happy leveraging the hard work of people who have spent more time focusing on grid layouts and spending my time concentrating on other aspects of my project.Also, and perhaps most importantly for me, the 960 framework sports the following tagline: “Sketch, Design, Code.” As I hope this article has demonstrated, I was able to utilize 960’s resources starting with the brainstorming phase (via sketchseets), during the design phase (via grid templates), and finally throughout the implementation phase (via the grid template background images and the Compass plug-in). In short, 960 provides helpful resources that can, and I would argue should, be used from project inception to project end.</li>\n</ul>\nIn summary, if you want to leverage CSS frameworks while maintaining the semantic purity of your markup, take a moment to check out Compass. I think you’ll find it opens up a great new space of possibility.\n<h4>Resources:</h4>\n<ul>\n	<li><a title=\"Compass framwork at Github\" href=\"http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass/getting-started\">Compass Framework at Github</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"Compass Primer\" href=\"http://acts-as-architect.blogspot.com/2008/11/compass-primer.html\">Compass Primer</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"Compass 960 plug-in\" href=\"http://github.com/chriseppstein/compass-960-plugin/tree/master\">Compass 960 plug-in</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"Compass mailing list\" href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/compass-users\">Compass mailing list</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"Sass\" href=\"http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html\">Sass</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"The 960 CSS Framework\" href=\"http://960.gs\">The 960 CSS Framework</a></li>\n	<li><a title=\"The Grid System\" href=\"http://www.thegridsystem.org/\">The Grid System</a></li>\n</ul>','aa-Compass, the 960 CSS framework, and Semantic Markup','','publish','open','open','','compass-the-960-css-framework-and-semantic-markup','','','2009-03-28 13:17:47','2009-03-28 13:17:47','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?p=54',0,'post','',0),(8,1,'2009-04-15 00:05:35','2009-04-15 00:05:35','<strong>By Cory Doctorow</strong>\n\nSuzanne Church almost never had to bother with the blue blazer these days. Back at the height of the dot-boom, she’d put on her business journalist drag—blazer, blue sailcloth shirt, khaki trousers, loafers—just about every day, putting in her obligatory appearances at splashy press-conferences for high-flying IPOs and mergers. These days, it was mostly work at home or one day a week at the San Jose Mercury News’s office, in comfortable light sweaters with loose necks and loose cotton pants that she could wear straight to yoga after shutting her computer’s lid.\n\nBlue blazer today, and she wasn’t the only one. There was Reedy from the NYT’s Silicon Valley office, and Tribbey from the WSJ, and that despicable rat-toothed jumped-up gossip columnist from one of the UK tech-rags, and many others besides. Old home week, blue blazers fresh from the dry-cleaning bags that had guarded them since the last time the NASDAQ broke 5,000.\n\nThe man of the hour was Landon Kettlewell—the kind of outlandish prep-school name that always seemed a little made up to her—the new CEO and front for the majority owners of Kodak/Duracell. The despicable Brit had already started calling them Kodacell. Buying the company was pure Kettlewell: shrewd, weird, and ethical in a twisted way.\n\n“Why the hell have you done this, Landon?” Kettlewell asked himself into his tie-mic. Ties and suits for the new Kodacell execs in the room, like surfers playing dress-up. “Why buy two dinosaurs and stick ’em together? Will they mate and give birth to a new generation of less-endangered dinosaurs?”\n\n<a name=\"more\"></a>\n\nHe shook his head and walked to a different part of the stage, thumbing a PowerPoint remote that advanced his slide on the jumbotron to a picture of a couple of unhappy cartoon brontos staring desolately at an empty nest. “Probably not. But there is a good case for what we’ve just done, and with your indulgence, I’m going to lay it out for you now.”\n\n“Let’s hope he sticks to the cartoons,” Rat-Toothed hissed beside her. His breath smelled like he’d been gargling turds. He had a not-so-secret crush on her and liked to demonstrate his alpha-maleness by making half-witticisms into her ear. “They’re about his speed.”\n\nShe twisted in her seat and pointedly hunched over her computer’s screen, to which she’d taped a thin sheet of polarized plastic that made it opaque to anyone shoulder-surfing her. Being a halfway attractive woman in Silicon Valley was more of a pain in the ass than she’d expected, back when she’d been covering rustbelt shenanigans in Detroit, back when there was an auto industry in Detroit.\n\nThe worst part was that the Brit’s reportage was just spleen-filled editorializing on the lack of ethics in the valley’s board-rooms (a favorite subject of hers, which no doubt accounted for his fellow-feeling), and it was also the crux of Kettlewell’s schtick. The spectacle of an exec who talked ethics enraged Rat-Toothed more than the vilest baby-killers. He was the kind of revolutionary who liked his firing squads arranged in a circle.\n\n“I’m not that dumb, folks,” Kettlewell said, provoking a stagey laugh from Mr Rat-Tooth. “Here’s the thing: the market had valued these companies at less than their cash on hand. They have twenty billion in the bank and a 16 billion dollar market-cap. We just made four billion dollars, just by buying up the stock and taking control of the company. We could shut the doors, stick the money in our pockets, and retire.”\n\nSuzanne took notes. She knew all this, but Kettlewell gave good sound-bite, and talked slow in deference to the kind of reporter who preferred a notebook to a recorder. “But we’re not gonna do that.” He hunkered down on his haunches at the edge of the stage, letting his tie dangle, staring spacily at the journalists and analysts. “Kodacell is bigger than that.” He’d read his email that morning then, and seen Rat-Toothed’s new moniker. “Kodacell has goodwill. It has infrastructure. Administrators. Physical plant. Supplier relationships. Distribution and logistics. These companies have a lot of useful plumbing and a lot of priceless reputation.\n\n“What we don’t have is a product. There aren’t enough buyers for batteries or film—or any of the other stuff we make—to occupy or support all that infrastructure. These companies slept through the dot-boom and the dot-bust, trundling along as though none of it mattered. There are parts of these businesses that haven’t changed since the fifties.\n\n“We’re not the only ones. Technology has challenged and killed businesses from every sector. Hell, IBM <em>doesn’t make computers anymore</em>! The very idea of a travel agent is inconceivably weird today! And the record labels, oy, the poor, crazy, suicidal, stupid record labels. Don’t get me started.\n\n“Capitalism is eating itself. The market works, and when it works, it commodifies or obsoletes everything. That’s not to say that there’s no money out there to be had, but the money won’t come from a single, monolithic product line. The days of companies with names like ‘General Electric’ and ‘General Mills’ and ‘General Motors’ are over. The money on the table is like krill: a billion little entrepreneurial opportunities that can be discovered and exploited by smart, creative people.\n\n“We will brute-force the problem-space of capitalism in the twenty first century. Our business plan is simple: we will hire the smartest people we can find and put them in small teams. They will go into the field with funding and communications infrastructure—all that stuff we have left over from the era of batteries and film—behind them, capitalized to find a place to live and work, and a job to do. A business to start. Our company isn’t a project that we pull together on, it’s a <em>network</em> of like-minded, cooperating autonomous teams, all of which are empowered to do whatever they want, provided that it returns something to our coffers. We will explore and exhaust the realm of commercial opportunities, and seek constantly to refine our tactics to mine those opportunities, and the krill will strain through our mighty maw and fill our hungry belly. This company isn’t a company anymore: this company is a network, an approach, a sensibility.”\n\nSuzanne’s fingers clattered over her keyboard. The Brit chuckled nastily. “Nice talk, considering he just made a hundred thousand people redundant,” he said. Suzanne tried to shut him out: yes, Kettlewell was firing a company’s worth of people, but he was also saving the company itself. The prospectus had a decent severance for all those departing workers, and the ones who’d taken advantage of the company stock-buying plan would find their pensions augmented by whatever this new scheme could rake in. If it worked.\n\n“Mr Kettlewell?” Rat-Toothed had clambered to his hind legs.\n\n“Yes, Freddy?” Freddy was Rat-Toothed’s given name, though Suzanne was hard pressed to ever retain it for more than a few minutes at a time. Kettlewell knew every business-journalist in the Valley by name, though. It was a CEO thing.\n\n“Where will you recruit this new workforce from? And what kind of entrepreneurial things will they be doing to ‘exhaust the realm of commercial activities’?”\n\n“Freddy, we don’t have to recruit anyone. They’re beating a path to our door. <em>This</em> is a nation of manic entrepreneurs, the kind of people who’ve been inventing businesses from video arcades to photomats for centuries.” Freddy scowled skeptically, his jumble of grey tombstone teeth protruding. “Come on, Freddy, you ever hear of the Grameen Bank?”\n\nFreddy nodded slowly. “In India, right?”\n\n“Bangladesh. Bankers travel from village to village on foot and by bus, finding small co-ops who need tiny amounts of credit to buy a cellphone or a goat or a loom in order to grow. The bankers make the loans and advise the entrepreneurs, and the payback rate is fifty times higher than the rate at a regular lending institution. They don’t even have a written lending agreement: entrepreneurs—real, hard-working entrepreneurs—you can trust on a handshake.”\n\n“You’re going to help Americans who lost their jobs in your factories buy goats and cellphones?”\n\n“We’re going to give them loans and coordination to start businesses that use information, materials science, commodified software and hardware designs, and creativity to wring a profit from the air around us. Here, catch!” He dug into his suit-jacket and flung a small object toward Freddy, who fumbled it. It fell onto Suzanne’s keyboard.\n\nShe picked it up. It looked like a keychain laser-pointer, or maybe a novelty light-saber.\n\n“Switch it on, Suzanne, please, and shine it, oh, on that wall there.” Kettlewell pointed at the upholstered retractable wall that divided the hotel ballroom into two functional spaces.\n\nSuzanne twisted the end and pointed it. A crisp rectangle of green laser-light lit up the wall.\n\n“Now, watch this,” Kettlewell said.\n\nNOW WATCH THIS\n\nThe words materialized in the middle of the rectangle on the distant wall.\n\n“Testing one two three,” Kettlewell said.\n\nTESTING ONE TWO THREE\n\n“Donde esta el baño?”\n\nWHERE IS THE BATHROOM\n\n“What is it?” said Suzanne. Her hand wobbled a little and the distant letters danced.\n\nWHAT IS IT\n\n“This is a new artifact designed and executed by five previously out-of-work engineers in Athens, Georgia. They’ve mated a tiny Linux box with some speaker-independent continuous speech recognition software, a free software translation engine that can translate between any of twelve languages, and an extremely high-resolution LCD that blocks out words in the path of the laser-pointer.\n\n“Turn this on, point it at a wall, and start talking. Everything said shows up on the wall, in the language of your choosing, regardless of what language the speaker was speaking.”\n\nAll the while, Kettlewell’s words were scrolling by in black block caps on that distant wall: crisp, laser-edged letters.\n\n“This thing wasn’t invented. All the parts necessary to make this go were just lying around. It was <em>assembled</em>. A gal in a garage, her brother the marketing guy, her husband overseeing manufacturing in Belgrade. They needed a couple grand to get it all going, and they’ll need some life-support while they find their natural market.\n\n“They got twenty grand from Kodacell this week. Half of it a loan, half of it equity. And we put them on the payroll, with benefits. They’re part freelancer, part employee, in a team with backing and advice from across the whole business.\n\n“It was easy to do once. We’re going to do it ten thousand times this year. We’re sending out talent scouts, like the artists and representation people the record labels used to use, and they’re going to sign up a lot of these bands for us, and help them to cut records, to start businesses that push out to the edges of business.\n\n“So, Freddy, to answer your question, no, we’re not giving them loans to buy cellphones and goats.”\n\nKettlewell beamed. Suzanne twisted the laser-pointer off and made ready to toss it back to the stage, but Kettlewell waved her off.\n\n“Keep it,” he said. It was suddenly odd to hear him speak without the text crawl on that distant wall. She put the laser pointer in her pocket and reflected that it had the authentic feel of cool, disposable technology: the kind of thing on its way from a startup’s distant supplier to the schwag bags at high-end technology conferences to blister-packs of six hanging in the impulse aisle at Fry’s.\n\nShe tried to imagine the technology conferences she’d been to with the addition of the subtitling and translation and couldn’t do it. Not conferences. Something else. A kids’ toy? A tool for Starbucks-smashing anti-globalists, planning strategy before a WTO riot? She patted her pocket.\n\nFreddy hissed and bubbled like a teakettle beside her, fuming. “What a cock,” he muttered. “Thinks he’s going to hire ten thousand teams to replace his workforce, doesn’t say a word about what <em>that</em> lot is meant to be doing now he’s shitcanned them all. Utter bullshit. Irrational exuberance gone berserk.”\n\nSuzanne had a perverse impulse to turn the wand back on and splash Freddy’s bilious words across the ceiling, and the thought made her giggle. She suppressed it and kept on piling up notes, thinking about the structure of the story she’d file that day.\n\nKettlewell pulled out some charts and another surfer in a suit came forward to talk money, walking them through the financials. She’d read them already and decided that they were a pretty credible bit of fiction, so she let her mind wander.\n\nShe was a hundred miles away when the ballroom doors burst open and the unionized laborers of the former Kodak and the former Duracell poured in on them, tossing literature into the air so that it snowed angry leaflets. They had a big drum and a bugle, and they shook tambourines. The hotel rent-a-cops occasionally darted forward and grabbed a protestor by the arm, but her colleagues would immediately swarm them and pry her loose and drag her back into the body of the demonstration. Freddy grinned and shouted something at Kettlewell, but it was lost in the din. The journalists took a lot of pictures.\n\nSuzanne closed her computer’s lid and snatched a leaflet out of the air. WHAT ABOUT US? it began, and talked about the workers who’d been at Kodak and Duracell for twenty, thirty, even forty years, who had been conspicuously absent from Kettlewell’s stated plans to date.\n\nShe twisted the laser-pointer to life and pointed it back at the wall. Leaning in very close, she said, “What are your plans for your existing workforce, Mr Kettlewell?”\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR PLANS FOR YOUR EXISTING WORKFORCE MR KETTLEWELL\n\nShe repeated the question several times, refreshing the text so that it scrolled like a stock ticker across that upholstered wall, an illuminated focus that gradually drew all the attention in the room. The protestors saw it and began to laugh, then they read it aloud in ragged unison, until it became a chant: WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS—<em>thump</em> of the big drum—FOR YOUR EXISTING WORKFORCE <em>thump</em> MR <em>thump</em> KETTLEWELL?\n\nSuzanne felt her cheeks warm. Kettlewell was looking at her with something like a smile. She liked him, but that was a personal thing and this was a truth thing. She was a little embarrassed that she had let him finish his spiel without calling him on that obvious question. She felt tricked, somehow. Well, she was making up for it now.\n\nOn the stage, the surfer-boys in suits were confabbing, holding their thumbs over their tie-mics. Finally, Kettlewell stepped up and held up his own laser-pointer, painting another rectangle of light beside Suzanne’s.\n\n“I’m glad you asked that, Suzanne,” he said, his voice barely audible.\n\nI’M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT SUZANNE\n\nThe journalists chuckled. Even the chanters laughed a little. They quieted down.\n\n“I’ll tell you, there’s a downside to living in this age of wonders: we are moving too fast and outstripping the ability of our institutions to keep pace with the changes in the world.”\n\nFreddy leaned over her shoulder, blowing shit-breath in her ear. “Translation: you’re ass-fucked, the lot of you.”\n\nTRANSLATION YOUR ASS FUCKED THE LOT OF YOU\n\nSuzanne yelped as the words appeared on the wall and reflexively swung the pointer around, painting them on the ceiling, the opposite wall, and then, finally, in miniature, on her computer’s lid. She twisted the pointer off.\n\nFreddy had the decency to look slightly embarrassed and he slunk away to the very end of the row of seats, scooting from chair to chair on his narrow butt. On stage, Kettlewell was pretending very hard that he hadn’t seen the profanity, and that he couldn’t hear the jeering from the protestors now, even though it had grown so loud that he could no longer be heard over it. He kept on talking, and the words scrolled over the far wall.\n\nTHERE IS NO WORLD IN WHICH KODAK AND DURACELL GO ON MAKING FILM AND BATTERIES\n\nTHE COMPANIES HAVE MONEY IN THE BANK BUT IT HEMORRHAGES OUT THE DOOR EVERY DAY\n\nWE ARE MAKING THINGS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BUY\n\nTHIS PLAN INCLUDES A GENEROUS SEVERANCE FOR THOSE STAFFERS WORKING IN THE PARTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT WILL CLOSE DOWN\n\n-- Suzanne admired the twisted, long-way-around way of saying, “the people we’re firing.” Pure CEO passive voice. She couldn’t type notes and read off the wall at the same time. She whipped out her little snapshot and monkeyed with it until it was in video mode and then started shooting the ticker.\n\nBUT IF WE ARE TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT SEVERANCE WE NEED TO BE IN BUSINESS\n\nWE NEED TO BE BRINGING IN A PROFIT SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS TO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS SHAREHOLDERS AND WORKFORCE ALIKE\n\nWE CAN’T PAY A PENNY IN SEVERANCE IF WE’RE BANKRUPT\n\nWE ARE HIRING 50000 NEW EMPLOYEES THIS YEAR AND THERE’S NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT THOSE NEW PEOPLE CAN’T COME FROM WITHIN\n\nCURRENT EMPLOYEES WILL BE GIVEN CONSIDERATION BY OUR SCOUTS\n\nENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A DEEPLY AMERICAN PRACTICE AND OUR WORKERS ARE AS CAPABLE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTION AS ANYONE\n\nI AM CONFIDENT WE WILL FIND MANY OF OUR NEW HIRES FROM WITHIN OUR EXISTING WORKFORCE\n\nI SAY THIS TO OUR EMPLOYEES IF YOU HAVE EVER DREAMED OF STRIKING OUT ON YOUR OWN EXECUTING ON SOME AMAZING IDEA AND NEVER FOUND THE MEANS TO DO IT NOW IS THE TIME AND WE ARE THE PEOPLE TO HELP\n\nSuzanne couldn’t help but admire the pluck it took to keep speaking into the pointer, despite the howls and bangs.\n\n“C’mon, I’m gonna grab some bagels before the protestors get to them,” Freddy said, plucking at her arm—apparently, this was his version of a charming pickup line. She shook him off authoritatively, with a whip-crack of her elbow.\n\nFreddy stood there for a minute and then moved off. She waited to see if Kettlewell would say anything more, but he twisted the pointer off, shrugged, and waved at the hooting protestors and the analysts and the journalists and walked off-stage with the rest of the surfers in suits.\n\nShe got some comments from a few of the protestors, some details. Worked for Kodak or Duracell all their lives. Gave everything to the company. Took voluntary pay-cuts under the old management five times in ten years to keep the business afloat, now facing layoffs as a big fat thank-you-suckers. So many kids. Such and such a mortgage.\n\nShe knew these stories from Detroit: she’d filed enough copy with varying renditions of it to last a lifetime. Silicon Valley was supposed to be different. Growth and entrepreneurship—a failed company was just a stepping-stone to a successful one, can’t win them all, dust yourself off and get back to the garage and start inventing. There’s a whole world waiting out there!\n\nMother of three. Dad whose bright daughter’s university fund was raided to make ends meet during the “temporary” austerity measures. This one has a Down’s Syndrome kid and that one worked through three back surgeries to help meet production deadlines.\n\nHalf an hour before she’d been full of that old Silicon Valley optimism, the sense that there was a better world a-borning around her. Now she was back in that old rustbelt funk, with the feeling that she was witness not to a beginning, but to a perpetual ending, a cycle of destruction that would tear down everything solid and reliable in the world.\n\nShe packed up her laptop and stepped out into the parking lot. Across the freeway, she could make out the bones of the Great America fun-park roller-coasters whipping around and around in the warm California sun.\n\nThese little tech-hamlets down the 101 were deceptively utopian. All the homeless people were miles north on the streets of San Francisco, where pedestrian marks for panhandling could be had, where the crack was sold on corners instead of out of the trunks of fresh-faced, friendly coke-dealers’ cars. Down here it was giant malls, purpose-built dot-com buildings, and the occasional fun-park. Palo Alto was a university-town theme-park, provided you steered clear of the wrong side of the tracks, the East Palo Alto slums that were practically shanties.\n\nChrist, she was getting melancholy. She didn’t want to go into the office—not today. Not when she was in this kind of mood. She would go home and put her blazer back in the closet and change into yoga togs and write her column and have some good coffee.\n\nShe nailed up the copy in an hour and emailed it to her editor and poured herself a glass of Napa red (the local vintages in Michigan likewise left something to be desired) and settled onto her porch, overlooking the big reservoir off 280 near Mountain View.\n\nThe house had been worth a small fortune at the start of the dot-boom, but now, in the resurgent property boom, it was worth a large fortune and then some. She could conceivably sell this badly built little shack with its leaky hot-tub for enough money to retire on, if she wanted to live out the rest of her days in Sri Lanka or Nebraska.\n\n“You’ve got no business feeling poorly, young lady,” she said to herself. “You are as well set-up as you could have dreamed, and you are right in the thick of the weirdest and best time the world has yet seen. And Landon Kettlewell knows your name.”\n\nShe finished the wine and opened her computer. It was dark enough now with the sun set behind the hills that she could read the screen. The Web was full of interesting things, her email full of challenging notes from her readers, and her editor had already signed off on her column.\n\nShe was getting ready to shut the lid and head for bed, so she pulled her mail once more.\n<blockquote>From: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\n\nTo: schurch@sjmercury.com\n\nSubject: Embedded journalist?\n\nThanks for keeping me honest today, Suzanne. It’s the hardest question we’re facing today: what happens when all the things you’re good at are no good to anyone anymore? I hope we’re going to answer that with the new model.\n\nYou do good work, madam. I’d be honored if you’d consider joining one of our little teams for a couple months and chronicling what they do. I feel like we’re making history here and we need someone to chronicle it.\n\nI don’t know if you can square this with the Merc, and I suppose that we should be doing this through my PR people and your editor, but there comes a time about this time every night when I’m just too goddamned hyper to bother with all that stuff and I want to just DO SOMETHING instead of ask someone else to start a process to investigate the possibility of someday possibly maybe doing something.\n\nWill you do something with us, if we can make it work? 100 percent access, no oversight? Say you will. Please.\n\nYour pal,\n\nKettlebelly</blockquote>\nShe stared at her screen. It was like a work of art; just look at that return address, “kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com”—for kodacell.com to be live and accepting mail, it had to have been registered the day before. She had a vision of Kettlewell checking his email at midnight before his big press-conference, catching Freddy’s column, and registering kodacell.com on the spot, then waking up some sysadmin to get a mail server answering at skunkworks.kodacell.com. Last she’d heard, Lockheed-Martin was threatening to sue anyone who used their trademarked term “Skunk Works” to describe a generic R&amp;D department. That meant that Kettlewell had moved so fast that he hadn’t even run this project by legal. She was willing to bet that he’d already ordered new business-cards with the address on them.\n\nThere was a guy she knew, an editor at a mag who’d assigned himself a plum article that he’d run on his own cover. He’d gotten a book-deal out of it. A half-million dollar book-deal. If Kettlewell was right, then the exclusive book on the inside of the first year at Kodacell could easily make that advance. And the props would be mad, as the kids said.\n\nKettlebelly! It was such a stupid frat-boy nickname, but it made her smile. He wasn’t taking himself seriously, or maybe he was, but he wasn’t being a pompous ass about it. He was serious about changing the world and frivolous about everything else. She’d have a hard time being an objective reporter if she said yes to this.\n\nShe couldn’t possibly decide at this hour. She needed a night’s sleep and she had to talk this over with the Merc. If she had a boyfriend, she’d have to talk it over with him, but that wasn’t a problem in her life these days.\n\nShe spread on some expensive duty-free French wrinkle-cream and brushed her teeth and put on her nightie and double-checked the door locks and did all the normal things she did of an evening. Then she folded back her sheets, plumped her pillows and stared at them.\n\nShe turned on her heel and stalked back to her computer and thumped the spacebar until the thing woke from sleep.\n<blockquote>From: schurch@sjmercury.com\n\nTo: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\n\nSubject: Re: Embedded journalist?\n\nKettlebelly: that is one dumb nickname. I couldn’t possibly associate myself with a grown man who calls himself Kettlebelly.\n\nSo stop calling yourself Kettlebelly, immediately. If you can do that, we’ve got a deal.\n\nSuzanne</blockquote>\nThere had come a day when her readers acquired email and the paper ran her address with her byline, and her readers had begun to write her and write her and write her. Some were amazing, informative, thoughtful notes. Some were the vilest, most bilious trolling. In order to deal with these notes, she had taught herself to pause, breathe, and re-read any email message before clicking send.\n\nThe reflex kicked in now and she re-read her note to Kettlebelly—Kettlewell!—and felt a crimp in her guts. Then she hit send.\n\nShe needed to pee, and apparently had done for some time, without realizing it. She was on the toilet when she heard the ping of new incoming mail.\n<blockquote>From: kettlewell-l@skunkworks.kodacell.com\n\nTo: schurch@sjmercury.com\n\nSubject: Re: Embedded journalist?\n\nI will never call myself Kettlebelly again.\n\nYour pal,\n\nKettledrum.</blockquote>\nOh-shit-oh-shit-oh-shit. She did a little two-step at her bed’s edge. Tomorrow she’d go see her editor about this, but it just felt <em>right</em>, and exciting, like she was on the brink of an event that would change her life forever.\n\nIt took her three hours of mindless Web-surfing, including a truly dreary Hot-Or-Not clicktrance and an hour’s worth of fiddling with tweets from the press-conference, before she was able to lull herself to sleep. As she nodded off, she thought that Kettlewell’s insomnia was as contagious as his excitement.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.tor.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=blog&amp;id=37713\">Continue to Part 2</a>','aa-Makers','','publish','open','closed','','makers','','','2009-04-15 00:05:35','2009-04-15 00:05:35','',38,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?page_id=8',0,'page','',0),(61,1,'2009-04-24 13:27:53','2009-04-24 13:27:53','<p align=\"left\"><img src=\"http://www.seomoz.org/img/upload/Image/stuck%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"276\" height=\"195\" align=\"right\" /></p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Linked Images from Other Site</li>\n</ul>\nOriginal Post: <a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/web-design-tactics\">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/web-design-tactics</a>\n<p align=\"left\">Web design can be incredibly frustrating.  You\'d think that with the infinite possibilities of what-goes-where it\'d be pretty easy to land a design that works, yet somehow we\'ve all been stuck before: working hour after hour on a design that refuses to look right.  Throwing away pixels like they\'re going out of style.</p>\n\nThese 8 tactics are what I use to get out of that sticky spot.\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Design from the inside out </strong>\nThis is some of the best advice anyone ever gave me about web design (thanks <a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/redesigning-seomoz#jtc1848\">Cameron</a>).  A lot of designers start off a design by focusing on the header.  Often times what\'s <em>inside</em> the page is what makes it look good; the header is supplementary.  Try leaving the header alone for awhile and working on some elements in the body, you\'ll be surprised at how much easier it is to design a page once you\'ve got a solid body going.  The next time you\'re designing a header with no body imagine yourself adjusting a tie in front of the mirror, but being completely nude.   (yikes)</li>\n	<li><strong>Sketch something</strong>\nMy whiteboard is my salvation.  Pencil and paper works too.   I read an article years ago by a designer who would draw dozens of little 2x3\" mockups in his spiral notebook before even opening up a graphic design program.  It helped him identify where elements were going to be placed and what options looked best .  The best part of creating mockups this way is the speed at which you can burn through possible layout ideas.  Sketch something, scribble it out.  Sketch something else, scribble it out.  Do this ten times and you\'ve probably got a fairly decent idea of how to the page should come together.  I\'ve used a few wireframe applications like <a href=\"http://www.axure.com/\">Axure</a>, but I\'ve still found myself to be my most efficient while bathed in the saucy aroma of whiteboard markers.</li>\n	<li><strong>Seek inspiration offline\n</strong>If you\'ve paid attention to anything design related in the past two years then you\'ve no doubt seen a few of the countless CSS galleries and design showcase websites that popped up.  These are excellent sources of inspiration, but sometimes a bit of offline media can be just what you need to spur some fresh ideas.   Open up a newspaper or magazine, go to the grocery store and look at the packaging, watch a television ad.   Pay attention to things that are applicable to your design such as typography, color, and element placement.  Ask yourself questions like \"What is it I like about this magazine ad?\" and \"What is about this packaging that just works?\"  There\'s a lot you can learn from observing traditional media.  A few years ago a co-worker of mine lent me a book full of Russian posters and print ads from the 1920\'s.  The lessons learned from looking at some of the material were invaluable - I was particularly impressed by how they were able to cram a ton of information into a tiny area but kept it from appearing too \"busy.\"</li>\n	<li><strong>Learn to let it go\n</strong> Ever make a button that looks ridiculously awesome but just doesn\'t belong in your design?  You put so much effort into your ridiculously awesome button, you\'ll go to great lengths to make it work.  You\'ll bend the laws of space and time to make that goddamn button look right in your page.\n\nLearn to let it go.  Save the button and file it away.   Although you\'ve lost this battle, you\'ll soon have an arsenal of ridiculously awesome buttons you can use in designs later on.</li>\n	<li><strong>Step away from the computer\n</strong> We\'ve all heard this before: If you\'re having a difficult time with something, leave it alone for awhile and come back later.  It\'ll probably be easier after you\'ve had a bit of a break and your mind has settled.  Regarding web design, I\'ve noticed this always plays out in a certain way:  If I\'m hating a design I\'m working on and I shelve it for a few days,  a lot of the time my reaction upon returning will be \"Holy crap that\'s fantastic!\"   On the flip-side, I\'ll often toil away long into the night working on what looks like the best design I\'ve ever created.  The next morning I\'ll look at it again and cringe at the horrible abomination I\'ve created.    The moral here is to give your design some space.</li>\n	<li><strong>Be absorbent</strong>\nNo art is born in a vacuum.  Learn to effectively pinpoint what it is you love about other designer\'s work and incorporate it into your own.    Don\'t steal designs, but don\'t deprive yourself of external stimuli either.  Become better at identifying <em>why</em> you love the way something looks.   When I come across a design that blows my mind, I try to pick it apart what aesthetically makes it tick.\n<a href=\"http://www.tangerine-tree.net/\">The Tangerine Tree</a> is a good example.  Sure, it looks wonderful, but why?  Personally, I love the way the designer has taken a very modern set of shapes and applied them against a vintage medium: Cartoonish bubbles and clouds that appear to be cut out of distressed paper.  When looking at this design I ask myself: What could I do with textures like that?  What is it about those shapes and icons that look so remarkable?</li>\n	<li><strong>Don\'t be a one-hit-wonder</strong>\nTry to avoid using the same techniques over and over again, even if you\'ve done really well with them in the past.  Gradient rectangles are my crutch - I have a terrible habit of using them whenever I feel like a design isn\'t working.  \"This design sucks...I\'ll add a rectangle with a gradient fill!\"  The result is usually something that I\'m unhappy with because it looks the same as all my previous work.  Try imposing yourself with silly rules, such as \"No drop shadows today\" or  \"2D elements ONLY.\"  Locking yourself out from certain design habits forces you to learn new ones.   My happiness as a designer coincides with my ability to produce something that looks great but is different from anything I\'ve done before.</li>\n	<li><strong>Seek input from others\n</strong>This is a tricky one.  There are so many ways to <a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/how-to-ruin-a-web-design-the-design-curve\">ruin a web design</a>, especially when the wrong kinds of people are involved.  Be careful who you ask and find people who can provide constructive criticism.  I\'ve seen many great designs die at the hands of aesthetically-challenged secretaries who have printed a few corporate bake-sale flyers in the past and consider themselves to EXPERTS at all things design.  If anyone ever tells you that your design doesn\'t \"<em>feel right</em>,\" or that they \"<em>just don\'t like it</em>,\" you might want to look elsewhere for input.  Find someone who can tell you specifically what\'s wrong and how it could be improved.   Grow some thick skin, too. Don\'t assume every criticism is an attack on your work of art.    Roll with the punches.</li>\n</ol>\nAny other techniques you can think of to jumpstart your design powers?<small>\n</small>','aa-8 Web Design Tactics to Help You When You&#039;re Stuck','','publish','open','open','','8-web-design-tactics-to-help-you-when-youre-stuck','','','2009-04-24 13:27:53','2009-04-24 13:27:53','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?p=61',0,'post','',0),(64,1,'2009-04-30 13:31:03','2009-04-30 13:31:03','<ul>\n	<li>Short Post\n</li>\n</ul>\nOriginal Post: <a href=\"http://konigi.com/wiki/agile-process\">http://konigi.com/wiki/agile-process</a>\n<h2><span style=\"width: 69px; height: 21px;\"><span>About</span></span></h2>\nUser Experience Design in the Agile Software Development method and Agile Process.\n<h2 id=\"toc1\"><span style=\"width: 63px; height: 21px;\"><span>Agile </span></span><span style=\"width: 83px; height: 21px;\"><span>Method</span></span></h2>\nAgile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. The term was coined in the year 2001 when the Agile Manifesto was formulated.\n\nAgile methods generally promote a project management process that encourages frequent inspection and adaptation, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability, a set of engineering best practices that allow for rapid delivery of high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs and company goals. Conceptual foundations of this framework are found in modern approaches to operations management and analysis, such as lean manufacturing, soft systems methodology, speech act theory (network of conversations approach), and Six Sigma.\n\nSource: \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\">Agile Software Development</a>.\" <em>Wikipedia</em>.\n<h2 id=\"toc2\"><span style=\"width: 63px; height: 21px;\"><span>Agile </span></span><span style=\"width: 82px; height: 21px;\"><span>Design </span></span><span style=\"width: 85px; height: 21px;\"><span>Process</span></span></h2>\nAgile design is an interative design process fit into the Agile Design Method. A bit more exploration of this concept is described in James Hobart\'s article:\n\nWe’re faced with shorter timelines, more aggressive development goals, and limited resources to complete our projects. Each project requires a UI design strategy successfully implemented with the other aspects of the project. Agile design addresses these constraints by limiting the level of documentation to a point that works well for the team based on the skill, complexity, and proximity of the team participants. Agile design acknowledges that great user interfaces are an iterative process and require time-tested, user-centered design techniques as a foundation for success.\n\nAgile design is built upon the principles established by a talented team of professionals who wrote a manifesto on agile development to address the needs of the current development environment we all seem to face. We often attempt to layer usability into a fast moving agile development environment where successive iterations of the code base are commonplace. This approach can backfire if we insist on heavy documentation and human factors studies before getting prototypes in front of users. On the other hand, just putting a few developers in a room with some end users can often result in a product that works for a subset of users on the team, but not a product that truly delivers the benefits of user-centered design. This is because specific design decisions need to be validated with actual usability testing to verify how the users behave, rather than relying on what they think they want.\n\nSource: \"<a href=\"http://www.classicsys.com/css06/cfm/article.cfm?articleid=10\">Optimizing User Experience with Agile Design</a>.\" By James Hobart. <em>Classic Systems Solutions, Inc.</em>.\n<h2 id=\"toc3\"><span style=\"width: 90px; height: 21px;\"><span>Articles </span></span><span style=\"width: 48px; height: 21px;\"><span>and </span></span><span style=\"width: 155px; height: 21px;\"><span>Presentations </span></span><span style=\"width: 35px; height: 21px;\"><span>on </span></span><span style=\"width: 82px; height: 21px;\"><span>Design </span></span><span style=\"width: 26px; height: 21px;\"><span>in </span></span><span style=\"width: 42px; height: 21px;\"><span>the </span></span><span style=\"width: 63px; height: 21px;\"><span>Agile </span></span><span style=\"width: 85px; height: 21px;\"><span>Process</span></span></h2>\n<ul>\n	<li> \"<a href=\"http://designnotes.info/?p=1792\">Agile Design, Creative Mornings Presentation in New York City (May 2009)</a>.\" By Michael Surtees. <em>Design Notes</em>.</li>\n	<li> <a href=\"http://jounce.net/blog/2008/sep/23/agile-design-ux-web-20-expo/\">Design and UX in the Agile Process, Web 2.0 Expo presentation in New York City (September, 2008)</a>.\" By M.

Innovation is what every organization should be ruthlessly pursuing, right? Wrong.\n\nI\'d like to advance a hypothesis: awesomeness is the new innovation.\n\nLet\'s face it. \"Innovation\" feels like a relic of the industrial era. And it just might be the case that instead of chasing innovation, we should be innovating innovation — that innovation needs innovation. Why? When we examine the economics of innovation, three reasons emerge.\n\n<em>Innovation relies on obsolescence</em>. Innovation was a concept pioneered by the great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter\">Joseph Schumpeter.</a> And to subscribe to it requires us to accept his theory of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction\">creative destruction.</a> Gales of innovation make yesterday\'s goods and services obsolete. Yet, that, in turn, means that the price of innovation is recession and depression. The business cycle might never be vanquished — but it is getting more vicious with every decade. In an interdependent world, obsolescence is what\'s obsolete.\n\n<em>Innovation dries up our seedcorn</em>. Innovation in its purest Schumpeterian sense is undertaken by entrepreneurs. And so today, we\'ve got an economy where everything\'s for sale. Yet, little fundamentally new is being created. Businesses focus obsessively on the entrepreneurial aspects of commerce: we are focused still on selling the same old toxic, industrial era junk in slightly better ways. Yet, <a href=\"http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/09/the_mshaped_recovery.html\">the challenge of the 21st century isn\'t entrepreneurial as much as it is creative</a>: learning to create fundamentally better stuff in the first place.\n\n<em>Innovation often isn\'t</em>. Innovation means, naively, what is commercially novel. Yet, as the financial crisis proves, what is \"innovative\" is often value destructive and socially harmful. Financial \"innovation\" turned out to be <a href=\"http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/05/unnovation.html\">unnovative</a>: it has destroyed trillions in value - here are some <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8177814.stm\">staggering estimates</a> from the IMF.\n\nIt\'s time to ask: have the costs of innovation exceeded the benefits?\n\nA better concept, one built for a radically interdependent 21st century, is awesomeness. Here are the four pillars of awesomeness:\n\n<strong>Ethical production.</strong> Innovation turns a blind eye to ethics — or, worse, actively denies ethics. That\'s a natural result of putting entrepreneurship above all. <em>Buy low, sell high, create value.</em> That\'s so 20th century. Awesome stuff is produced ethically — in fact, without an ethical component, awesomeness isn\'t possible. Starbucks is shifting to Fair Trade coffee beans, for example. Why? Starbucks isn\'t just trying to innovate yet another flavour of sugar-water: it\'s trying to gain awesomeness.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/04/the_best_business_model_in_the.html\">Insanely great stuff.</a> </strong>What is innovative often fails to delight, inspire, and enlighten — because, as we\'ve discussed, innovation is less concerned with raw creativity. Awesomeness puts creativity front and center. Awesome stuff evokes an emotive reaction because it\'s fundamentally new, unexpected, and 1000x better. Just ask Steve Jobs. The iPhone and iPod were pooh-poohed by analysts, who questioned how innovative they really were — but the Steve has turned multiple industries upside down through the power of awesomeness.\n\n<strong>Love.</strong> You know what\'s funny about walking into an Apple Store? The people working there <em>care</em>. They don\'t just \"work at the Apple store\" — they love Apple. Contrast that with the alienating, soul-crushing experience of trying to buy something at Best Buy — where salespeople attack you out of greed. (Or, as editor extraordinaire Sarah Green put it, \"where you wander around for a full half-hour unable to find anyone to help you before you finally get the attention of some blue-shirted 12-year old who turns out to know nothing about the products she sells and ultimately end up committing hara-kiri with a Wii controller\"). <em>Their </em>goal is to sell; the goal of Apple Store employees is simply to show off their awesomeness, and let you share it. Love for what we do is the basis of all real value creation.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/07/the_value_every_business_needs.html\">Thick value</a>.</strong> It\'s the most hackneyed phrase in the corporate lexicon: adding value. Let\'s face it: most value is an illusion. Nokia, Motorola, and Sony tried for a decade to \"add value\" to their phones — yet not a single feature did. Food producers and pharmaceutical companies claim they\'re \"adding value,\" but mostly they\'re just mega-marketing.\n\nThe vast majority of companies — in my research, greater than 95% — can only create what I have termed thin value. Thick value is real, meaningful, and sustainable. It happens by making people authentically better off — not merely by adding more bells and whistles that your boss might like, but that cause customers to roll their eyes.\n\nLet\'s summarize. What is awesomeness? Awesomeness happens when thick — real, meaningful — value is created by people who love what they do, added to insanely great stuff, and multiplied by communities who are delighted and inspired because they are authentically better off. That\'s a better kind of innovation, built for 21st century economics.\n\nI\'ve talked to many boardrooms about awesomeness. Beancounters feel challenged and threatened by it, because it feels fuzzy and imprecise. Yet, it\'s anything but. <a href=\"http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/haque/2009/07/today_in_capitalism_20_1.html\">Gen M</a> knows \"awesomeness\" when we see it — that\'s why its part of our vernacular. It\'s a precise concept, with meaning, depth, and resonance.\n\nWhat makes some stuff awesome and other stuff merely (yawn) innovative? I\'ve outlined my answers, but they\'re far from the best, or even the only ones — so add your own thoughts in the comments.\n\nYou might be innovative — but are you awesome? For most, the answer is: no. Game over: in the 21st century, if you\'re merely innovative, prepare to be disrupted by awesomeness.</div>','aa-The Awesomeness Manifesto','','publish','open','closed','','the-awesomeness-manifesto','','','2009-09-24 00:02:59','2009-09-24 00:02:59','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?page_id=3',0,'page','',0),(24,1,'2009-09-24 00:26:34','2009-09-24 00:26:34','<ul>\n	<li>Lots of HTML attributes</li>\n	<li>Images with Multiple Alignments</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr /><strong>Headers</strong>\n\n<hr />\n<h1>Header H1</h1>\n<h2>Header H2</h2>\n<h3>Header H3</h3>\n<h4>Header H4</h4>\n<h5>Header H5</h5>\n<hr /><strong>Text</strong>\n\n<hr /><strong>This is STRONG Text</strong>\n\n<em>This is Emphasized (EM) Text</em>\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">This is Underline (U) Text</span>\n\n<small>This is SMALL Text</small>\n\n<code>This is CODE Text.

In fact, if you’re reading this, chances are you already have a blog of your own, or at the very least, are thinking of starting one.\n\nAs with all things in life, there are some pros and cons that come with the deal. Here are my top five reasons to blog… and my top five reasons <em>not to</em> blog:\n\n<strong>To blog:</strong>\n<img title=\"pros and cons of blogging\" src=\"http://blogsolid.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/pros-and-cons.jpg\" alt=\"pros and cons of blogging\" width=\"220\" height=\"220\" align=\"right\" />\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Communication</strong>\nMore personal than a press release, yet less personal than a phone call. Blogging is the perfect way of keeping friends, family and acquaintances up to date. Some of my favourite blogs are those of my friends who live abroad.</li>\n	<li><strong>Networking</strong>\nIt is amazing how many new people I have connected with through my blog, especially those who share similar views and interests.</li>\n	<li><strong>Promotion</strong>\nBlogging is a great tool for introducing yourself, your knowledge, your skills and your business to potential clients.</li>\n	<li><strong>Creativity</strong>\nLooking for an opportunity to develop your creative thinking and share ideas? Blogging squeezes your brain for creative juice. From philosophy to design and technical wizardry – blogging offers a very wide range of creative opportunities.</li>\n	<li><strong>Blogging</strong>\nOdd listing <em>blogging</em> as a benefit of <em>blogging</em>, but essentially a weblog (blog) is exactly that: a journal. It’s a good idea to keep track of a project, hobby, travel experience or simply <em>life. </em>You will probably find your blog to be be a valuable point of reference in future.</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>…or not to blog:</strong>\n<ol>\n	<li><strong>Commitment</strong>\nIf you start a blog, post two or three entries and then quit, it’s not much of a blog, is it? Unfortunately blogging requires some long-term commitment for it to have real value as a communication tool.</li>\n	<li><strong>Time</strong>\nBlogging takes time and if you don’t limit it, you could find that other essential daily tasks get neglected and your productivity is affected negatively.</li>\n	<li><strong>Discipline</strong>\nAs a creative process, blogging requires you to dream up fresh content on a regular basis. You might often find that you simply don’t feel like blogging. If you give in to that feeling, your blog will die a slow and quiet death.</li>\n	<li><strong>Solo\n</strong>Unfortunately blogging is not a very social affair. When last did you hear of someone inviting their friends over for a blog? Time spent blogging is time <em>not</em> spent walking the dog or hanging out with your loved ones.</li>\n	<li><strong>Computer</strong>\nDoes your work require you to spend a lot of time staring into that good ol’ computer screen… Blogging requires you to do the same!

We know what we <em>should</em> be doing, but some invisible hang-up keeps us on the line. Unfortunately, the guaranteed consequence of procrastination is <em>growth</em> in the scale of the task you’ve been putting off—as well as the anxiety that it creates. All the time you’re putting something off, your problem’s getting bigger—both in reality and in your head, where your colorful imagination is liable to turn even the most trivial item into an unsolvable juggernaut that threatens to overwhelm you. And that means extra stress, more procrastination, and the music goes round.\n\nMy favorite tonic for procrastination—which I have mentioned in passing previously—is what I call a <em>dash</em>, which is simply a short burst of focused activity during which you force yourself to do nothing but work on the procrastinated item for a <strong>very</strong> short period of time—perhaps as little as just one minute. By breaking a few tiny pebbles off of your perceived monolith, you end up psyching yourself out of your stupor, as well as making much-needed progress on your overdue project. Neat, huh?\n<h2>Why the Heck Should This Work?</h2>\nBy making even the most modest bit of progress on your hated task, you’ve done what once seemed impossible: <em>you got started</em>. When you realize how much of the anxiety you’d experienced was created in your head, you’ll experience huge relief and give yourself the jolt needed to get back on track.\n\nYou can do a dash any time and for virtually any kind of project. The task has not been conceived that cannot be made smaller and more <em>dash-able</em>.\n<h2>Three kinds of dashes</h2>\n<div style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px 8px; float: right;\"><a title=\"Time your dash\" href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/merlin/1394540/\"><img style=\"border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 5px 5px 10px 15px; padding: 10px; background: #eeeeee none repeat scroll 0% 0%; -moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-origin: padding; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous;\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/2/1394540_51a7b7ead6_m.jpg\" alt=\"Time your dash\" width=\"240\" height=\"196\" /></a>\n<div>\n<p style=\"margin: 0pt 5px 0pt 0pt; font-size: 80%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 120%; text-align: right;\" align=\"right\">Try using a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S4U7/43folders-20/\">kitchen timer</a>\nto run your time-based dash.\n\n</div>\n</div>\nPlan your dash based on whatever works best for both your project and the particular block that’s hanging you up. The key is to pick a goal that’s laughably modest. Seriously, this is not the place for extravagant predictions and overly ambitious goals (that’s probably what helped land you here, right?).\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Time-based dash</strong> - Most jobs lend themselves to a <em>time-based dash</em>, so pick up a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004S4U7/43folders-20/\">kitchen timer</a> at your local drugstore. Choose an amount of time that gives you enough room to do <em>something</em> but that’s brief enough to seem completely unintimidating. For some reason, eight minutes seems to work well for most of my own dashes.</li>\n	<li><strong>Unit-based dash</strong> - Alternatively, depending on the tasks you’ve been avoiding, you could go with a <em>unit-based dash</em>, during which you agree to plow through an arbitrary number of pieces associated with your project (such as pages to read, words to write, glasses to wash, etc.).</li>\n	<li><strong>Combination dash</strong> - In many cases, the best solution is a <em>combination dash</em>, in which you get to stop the hated work whenever you reach either the time or unit goal ﬁrst.</li>\n</ul>\nAbove all, remember that this is all about doing <em>something</em>, so pick a goal at which you can’t possibly fail.\n<h2>Some Sample Dashes</h2>\nHere are a few ideas to get you started, although dashes can work for virtually any project you’ve procrastinated–no matter how monolithic.\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>Messy garage</strong> - Goal: 10 minutes or 1 full garbage bag. Spend 10 minutes working in one area of the garage. Take out old papers, break down some boxes, or move the Christmas ornaments to the top shelf. When the timer buzzes at you, <em>stop</em>.</li>\n	<li><strong>College application</strong> - Goal: 5 minutes or 1 page. Start by ﬁlling in the easy boxes. If you reach the bottom of the page before time is up, <em>stop</em>.</li>\n	<li><strong>Overdue report</strong> - Goal: 10 minutes or 100 words. Just start writing, even if it’s complete crap. Just keep scribbling for 10 minutes or until you have a paragraph or two. When time’s up, <em>stop</em>.</li>\n	<li><strong>Holiday cards and family correspondence </strong> - Goal: 5 minutes or 2 notes. Grab a pen and start making with the nice. Tell them about Tyler’s big day at Computer Camp. Brag about Ashley-Marie’s jazz and tap recital. When you’ve hit two ﬁnished cards, <em>stop</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Feel Like Working More? <em>Well, do ya, punk? </em></h2>\nOnce you’ve made <em>any</em> progress on something you’ve been procrastinating–even the ridiculously minor amounts of progress you make in your dash–you might ﬁnd it irresistible to keep working at it. That’s okay. Seriously, go nuts.\n\nAlthough you <em>must</em> begin your dash with the conﬁdence that your life preserver is never more than a few minutes or units away, there’s nothing to stop you from paddling forward if you’re making happy progress. That’s the trick, and, believe it or not, it totally works. Give it 8 minutes, and ﬁnd out for yourself.','aa-Kick procrastination&#039;s ass: Run a dash','','publish','open','open','','kick-procrastinations-ass-run-a-dash','','','2009-09-24 02:23:19','2009-09-24 02:23:19','',0,'http://wordpress.milabs.org/?p=51',0,'post','',0),(58,1,'2009-09-24 13:26:16','2009-09-24 13:26:16','','aa-Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0','These guidelines explain how to make Web content  accessible to people with disabilities.
